        you ever wondered how a product recommender is built?  How you can infer the
        underlying sentiment from reviews?  How you can extract information from images
        to find visually-similar products to recommend?  How you construct an application
        that does all of these things in real time, and provides a front-end user
        experience?  That’s what you will build in this course!\n\nUsing what you’ve
        learned about machine learning thus far, you will build a general product
        recommender system that does much more than just find similar products  You
        will combine images of products with product descriptions and their reviews
        to create a truly innovative intelligent application.\n\nYou’ve probably heard
        that Deep Learning is making news across the world as one of the most promising
        techniques in machine learning, especially for analyzing image data. With
        every industry dedicating resources to unlock the deep learning potential,
        to be competitive, you will want to use these models in tasks such as image
        tagging, object recognition, speech recognition, and text analysis.  In this
        capstone, you will build deep learning models using neural networks, explore
        what they are, what they do, and how.  To remove the barrier introduced by
        designing, training, and tuning networks, and to be able to achieve high performance
        with less labeled data, you will also build deep learning classifiers tailored
        to your specific task using pre-trained models, which we call deep features.  \n\nAs
        a core piece of this capstone project, you will implement a deep learning
        model for image-based product recommendation.  You will then combine this
        visual model with text descriptions of products and information from reviews
        to build an exciting, end-to-end intelligent application that provides a novel
        product discovery experience.  You will then deploy it as a service, which
        you can share with your friends and potential employers.  \n\nLearning Outcomes:  By
        the end of this capstone, you will be able to:\n   -Explore a dataset of products,
        reviews and images.\n   -Build a product recommender.\n   -Describe how a
        neural network model is represented and how it encodes non-linear features.\n   -Combine
        different types of layers and activation functions to obtain better performance.\n   -Use
        pretrained models, such as deep features, for new classification tasks. \n   -Describe
        how these models can be applied in computer vision, text analytics and speech
        recognition.  \n   -Use visual features to find the products your users want.\n   -Incorporate
        review sentiment into the recommendation.\n   -Build an end-to-end application.\n   -Deploy
        it as a service.  \n   -Implement these techniques in Python.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bd/79e8104d0011e592b8a9c1c44cb3fe/gears-818461_1280.jpg","id":"Rr2thkIKEeWZtA4u62x6lQ","slug":"ml-capstone","name":"Machine

        part of the world faces specific vulnerabilities to climate change and has
        different opportunities to mitigate the effects and build resilience in the
        21st century. With the Paris Agreement at COP 21, the global community has
        signaled its intent to act. Indeed, without climate action, decades of development
        progress are threatened, meaning that we are at a ‘make it or break it’ point
        in time. This course presents the most recent scientific evidence, explains
        the different regional impacts and divulge climate action strategies, and
        some opportunities for you to take action on climate change.\n\nAbout the
        Course\n\nThis action-oriented MOOC gives you the opportunity to learn about
        regional climate change impacts and sector-specific strategies to increase
        resilience and move towards a low-carbon future. You will have the opportunity
        to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one
        or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan
        Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East
        Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\nTo do this, the MOOC brings together renowned
        scientists and policymakers to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific
        evidence on climate change, regional low emissions and climate resilient development
        strategies across sectors, and an overview of the Paris Agreement and other
        outcomes of COP 21.\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nOverview \n\nTurn Down the Heat:
        From Climate Science to Action is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks
        will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate
        change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world
        in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that
        are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate
        challenge, and on how individuals can take action.\n\nWeek 1:  Climate Change
        in the 21st Century\n\n•  Historical and projected observed changes in the
        climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century\n•  The potential
        of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21
        from 187 countries to induce climate action\n•  Trends in climate change impacts,
        including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and
        extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity \n•  Possible responses from
        natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat
        waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification\n\nWeek 2: Sectoral
        and Regional Impacts\n\n•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming
        above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each
        of the world’s regions\n•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production,
        water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected
        populations \n•  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won
        development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the
        need for urgent action now\n\nWeek 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change\n\n•  Region-specific
        discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing
        vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building
        climate resilience\n•  Perspectives from regional experts on their experiences
        in strategies and actions proposed in each region to help transition towards
        a low-emissions, climate-resilient development path \n\nWeek 4: What You Can
        Do\n\n•  Transformative impact of day-to-day changes when brought to a global
        scale\n•  The rationale for acting now, acting together and acting differently\n•  Examples

        kinds of communication can have the effect of a powerful presentation.  Even
        a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take
        action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into
        a leader.\n\nIn this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic
        videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The
        course develops through four themes—mastering fear, developing a creative
        formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room—so that
        you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  \n\nSuccessful
        presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They
        depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic
        Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore,
        is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express
        it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able
        to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/84/359f20267311e69594e35d2e0b5815/specialization-logo.jpg","id":"KlAJ6oysEeW79RIwiAyGoQ","slug":"presentation-skills","name":"Successful

        Sustainable urban transformation refers to structural transformation processes
        – multi-dimensional and radical change – that can effectively direct urban
        development towards ambitious sustainability and climate goals.\n\nWe will
        connect the key trends of urbanization, decarbonisation and sustainability.

        look at practices (what is happening in cities at present) and opportunities
        (what are the possibilities for cities going forwards into the future). We
        bring together a collection of diverse short films and key short readings
        on sustainable cities as well as interactive forums and a practical assignment
        to create an online learning community.\n\nThis course provides key examples
        of activities to promote sustainable cities in Scandinavia, Europe and around

        fortement couplés et complexes. Ils exigent une approche interdisciplinaire,
        afin d’adopter un vrai questionnement, au delà des préjugés et des idées reçues.
        \n\nC’est pourquoi des spécialistes reconnus dans les domaines de l’économie,
        de la démographie, de l’énergie, du climat, de l’eau et de l’agriculture,
        et issus des meilleurs institutions et centres de recherche français (CentraleSupélec,
        INED, Cnam, CEA, AgroParisTech), interviendront avec la volonté de confronter
        leurs points de vue et de débattre avec vous. \n\nLa démarche générale du
        cours consistera à examiner les enjeux du développement durable au regard
        d’études scientifiques rigoureuses et récentes, pour : \n •  donner et discuter
        des chiffres clés (de l’état des lieux aux futurs possibles) ;\n •  comprendre
        la construction de ces chiffres (hypothèses et limites des modèles scientifiques
        sur lesquels ils reposent) ;\n •  et aborder l’ensemble des enjeux dans leurs
        différentes dimensions (notamment de l’échelle locale à l’échelle mondiale).\n
        \nLe format du cours :\nHebdomadaire, sur 7 semaines, 1h de vidéo par semaine

        this course we study the ancient, Socratic art of blowing up your beliefs
        as you go, to make sure they''re built to last. We spend six weeks studying
        three Platonic dialogues - \"Euthyphro\", \"Meno\", \"Republic\" Book I -
        then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral
        theory and moral psychology. \n\nPlatonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher,
        but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher''s
        mouth. You''ll get a feel for it.\n\nWe have a book: the new 4th edition of
        \"Reason and Persuasion\", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring,
        the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material
        and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don''t worry! John Holbo knows
        better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material,
        but the presentation is different.) \n\nThe book is offered free in PDF form
        - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in
        print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.\n\nThe
        course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is
        intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new,
        odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging,
        interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the
        weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all
        these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun
        facts. Plus cartoons. \n\nThe results can get elaborate (some book chapters
        and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary
        of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons.
        But there''s no reason you can''t skip over and around to find whatever seems
        most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained
        in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.\n\nPlato has meant different
        things to different people. He''s got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his
        own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths
        for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices.
        (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should
        be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven''t been before.
        I wouldn''t presume to dictate more exactly.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2e/abd27b5ded8b660d20c3ae79c1a4d5/courselogo.jpg","name":"Reason

        MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing
        moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers.
        The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in
        a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs
        that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent
        program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result,
        MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences,
        through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is
        heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable
        skill in today’s job market.\n\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB

        about the technologies underlying experimentation used in systems biology,
        with particular focus on RNA sequencing, mass spec-based proteomics, flow/mass
        cytometry and live-cell imaging.\n\nA key driver of the systems biology field
        is the technology allowing us to delve deeper and wider into how cells respond
        to experimental perturbations. This in turns allows us to build more detailed
        quantitative models of cellular function, which can give important insight
        into applications ranging from biotechnology to human disease. This course
        gives a broad overview of a variety of current experimental techniques used
        in modern systems biology, with focus on obtaining the quantitative data needed
        for computational modeling purposes in downstream analyses. We dive deeply
        into four technologies in particular, mRNA sequencing, mass spectrometry-based
        proteomics, flow/mass cytometry, and live-cell imaging. These techniques are
        often used in systems biology and range from genome-wide coverage to single
        molecule coverage, millions of cells to single cells, and single time points
        to frequently sampled time courses. We present not only the theoretical background
        upon which these technologies work, but also enter real wet lab environments
        to provide instruction on how these techniques are performed in practice,
        and how resultant data are analyzed for quality and content.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/60/01cbf07d6b11e396d72d067a587519/Experimental_methods_logo.png","id":"iCIGe_T6EeS-1yIAC7MN4w","slug":"experimental-methods","name":"Experimental

        курса является знакомство слушателей с основными понятиями макроэкономики,
        с базовыми моделями и принципами, которые используются при анализе текущего
        состояния экономики той или иной страны, что позволит самостоятельно ориентироваться
        в происходящих процессах и явлениях, а также проводить оценку эффективности
        и необходимости проводимой государством макроэкономической политики.\n\nДанный
        курс покрывает на базовом уровне все основные темы макроэкономики. Примерно
        две трети курса посвящены анализу общего равновесия на рынках труда, заемных
        средств, финансовых, денежных, товарных рынках, а также международных потоков
        капитала. Изучается долгосрочный экономический рост, идущий за счет накопления
        капитальных мощностей и технического прогресса.  Вторая часть курса посвящена
        изучению природы краткосрочных колебаний вокруг долгосрочной траектории роста,
        таким как финансовый кризис и мировая рецессия 2008-2009 годов. Обсуждаются
        причины подобных спадов, а также оптимальная стабилизационная политика государства,

        learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly
        programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving
        cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved
        understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today
        that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers
        also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In
        this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques,
        and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
        More importantly, you''ll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings
        of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully
        apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you''ll learn about some
        of Silicon Valley''s best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine
        learning and AI.\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to machine learning,
        datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised
        learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
        neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction,
        recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning
        (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The
        course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that
        you''ll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots

        you’ll achieve:\nIn this project-centered course* you will build a modern
        computer system, from the ground up. We’ll divide this fascinating journey
        into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary
        logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose
        computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive
        way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\nThis
        is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the
        course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning
        experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering
        knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical
        materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based
        hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers
        in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will
        be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\n\nCourse format:\nThe
        course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures,
        and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module''s lectures,
        and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course
        can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own
        pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \"nand2tetris
        TED talk\".\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are
        designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project,
        with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing
        guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts
        as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also
        get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in
        your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished

        government?  Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?\n\nEven
        within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role
        and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing
        legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems,
        and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect
        individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps,
        by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the
        thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many
        cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.
        \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In
        this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions
        and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things
        to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and
        arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical
        thinkers such as Plato, Hugo Grotius, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, and James
        Madison, and more contemporary theorists such as Michelle Alexander, Kwame
        Anthony Appiah, Bryan Caplan, Angela Davis, Ronald Dworkin, Jon Elster, John
        Hart Ely, H.L.A. Hart, Michael Huemer, Andrew Rehfeld, and Jeremy Waldron.\n\nThe
        aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular
        view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed
        basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the

        is becoming increasingly widespread in industry. This trend is driven by the
        adoption of Scala as the main programming language for many applications.
        Scala fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package.
        It interoperates seamlessly with both Java and Javascript. Scala is the implementation
        language of many important frameworks, including Apache Spark, Kafka, and
        Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, Tumblr
        and also Coursera.\n\nIn this course you will discover the elements of the
        functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your
        daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning
        about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing
        of execution symbolically.\n\nThe course is hands on; most units introduce
        short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite
        you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented
        by a series programming projects as homework assignments.\n\nLearning Outcomes.
        By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n - understand the principles
        of functional programming,\n - write purely functional programs, using recursion,\n   pattern
        matching, and higher-order functions,\n - combine functional programming with
        objects and classes,\n - design immutable data structures,\n - reason about
        properties of functions,\n - understand generic types for functional programs\n\nRecommended
        background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency
        with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++,

        course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages,
        with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages
        ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent
        is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more
        effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis
        course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics
        -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs
        effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different
        languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular
        syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential
        for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs.
        Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots
        in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to
        look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some
        prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first
        module.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part
        B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A,
        the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the
        three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for
        a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in
        order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The
        three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial
        as Part B and Part C combined.\n\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list
        of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most
        course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/39a3f0373111e69ce719fe5f0d2d9d/Capture.png","id":"8om3I-4LEeSbxyIACw0OOQ","slug":"programming-languages","name":"Programming

        you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of
        the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income
        or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant
        for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our
        world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social
        Wellbeing\" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following
        five lectures: \n(1) The excess burden of taxation\n(2) Tax incidence: who
        bears the economic burden of tax?\n(3) Progressivity: definition and ways
        to achieve\n(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model\n(5)
        Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing\nIf
        you haven''t done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for
        the first part of the course: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -
        the Role of the State\". Taking both parts of the course would enable you
        to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth
        and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea
        that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness
        - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple
        words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent
        layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive.
        Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on
        policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable
        to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence
        of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty,
        gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work
        of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent
        system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social
        welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic
        angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how
        smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats
        to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the
        rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose
        a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major
        figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard''s Elhanan Helpman,
        Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and
        NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able
        to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an
        informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic
        policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection
        between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations
        of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness
        of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies
        being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their
        development, as a conscientious citizen.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/d44a90ad3a11e5a1295552b2c67443/Economic-Growth-_-Distributive-Justice.jpg","id":"DJfupMVPEeWLqBIulHpzDw","slug":"economic-growth-part-2","name":"Economic

        begins with one of the most common and important elements of the financial
        system – interest rates.  You will learn why interest rates have always been

        the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on
        consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of
        negative interest rates. Markets explains how interest rates change the value

        blues is an American art form and the most important musical form in jazz.
        Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar,
        this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are
        considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues,
        Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax,
        melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques.
        While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing
        from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity
        and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic

        deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved
        in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact
        with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These
        systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription,
        motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together
        to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action

        this class, we will derive equilibrium outcomes across a variety of market
        structures. We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure
        called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools
        to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme
        of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly
        equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity
        takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand
        equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to
        strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive
        arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game
        theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations
        where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries
        are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs
        when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution,
        and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts
        of this externality.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will
        be able to:\n•\tExplain how different market structures result in different
        resource allocations.\n•\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular
        market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after
        the impact of this external shock has played out.\n•\tEvaluate the efficiency
        of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of
        efficiency.  \n•\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with
        regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some
        markets.\n•\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.\n•\tUnderstand
        externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.\n\nThis

        course gives you a complete insight into the modern design of digital systems
        fundamentals from an eminently practical point of view. Unlike other more
        \"classic\" digital circuits courses, our interest focuses more on the system
        than on the electronics that support it. This approach will allow us to lay
        the foundation for the design of complex digital systems.\n\nYou will learn
        a set of design methodologies and will use a set of (educational-oriented)
        computer-aided-design tools (CAD) that will allow you not only to design small
        and medium size circuits, but also to access to higher level courses covering
        so exciting topics as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) design
        or computer architecture, to give just two examples.\n\nCourse topics are
        complemented with the design of a simple processor, introduced as a transversal
        example of a complex digital system. This example will let you understand
        and feel comfortable with some fundamental computer architecture terms as
        the instruction set, microprograms and microinstructions.\n\nAfter completing
        this course you will be able to:\n\n   * Design medium complexity digital

        course is for you if you are interested in transitioning toward a managerial

        in this area, you will be able to analyze innovations powering the rapid spread
        of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting
        data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional
        security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the
        nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated
        tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data
        exchange.\n\nIf you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes
        are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device
        (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh
        heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial
        resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on
        network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until
        you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources

        be able to explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate

        and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous

        six-week course titled Doing Business in Europe is the second in a series
        of three exploring some of the main business aspects of European Union law.
        Besides providing learners with a sound knowledge base of European laws and
        regulations relevant to establishing and managing a company within the European
        Union, the course also explores business considerations within a broader perspective
        by including inputs from leading law practitioners in the field. More specifically,
        the course discusses strategic and financial considerations within Company
        law, as well as Labour law issues such as restructuring enterprises, working
        conditions and handling crises situations. The course also examines other
        legal areas such as Tax law, Environmental law and Private International law,
        and how they tie in to doing business in Europe.\n\nAt the end of this course,
        you will have a basic understanding of how to:\n\n· Understand the relevant
        regulations governing the internal European Union market\n\n· Establish and
        run a company within the European Union\n\n· Employ staff and recognize workers’
        rights and obligations\n\n· Comply with tax regulations and environmental
        standards\n\n· Set up agreements and resolve cross-border disputes\n\n· Successfully
        analyse EU case law and draft case reports\n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nThe Lund
        series in European Business Law ranges from considering the basic structures
        and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized areas of European
        Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, examines the
        core structures and principles of the European Union. The third and final
        course, Competing in Europe, goes into depth concerning how to compete on
        the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. All three
        courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs
        and preferences.\n\nTo keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook
        page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach
        course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one
        week of work. A module includes a number of lectures and readings, and finishes
        with an assessment – a quiz or a peer graded assignment. The assessments are
        intended to encourage learning and ensure that you understand the material
        of the course. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary. \n\nCourse

        was founded in 1668. The Faulty of Law is a modern faculty with an international
        profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. The university
        offers two international Masters: European Business Law and Human Rights Law.
        The former provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the
        theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme
        provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework,
        which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business
        decision-makers. \n\nEducation, research and interaction with the surrounding
        community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between
        the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by
        the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business
        Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal
        studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active
        lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/af/06eda02b9011e5aeba9977309995f3/Courselogo_EBL.jpg","id":"DAJLDyr8EeWGvAojQA48rw","slug":"eu-law-doing-business","name":"European

        comme un cheminement libre mais bien balisé par six étapes : une mise en situation
        cartographique, l’étude d’un corpus documentaire, un gros plan sur les perceptions
        nationales et un éclairage sur l’actualité. Les acquis de ces quatre premières
        étapes peuvent ensuite être testés dans un quizz d’évaluation, et mis en pratique
        lors du jeu de rôle final ou serious game : un scenario européen, une mission
        et … des décisions à prendre ! \nLa septième séance propose des analyses nouvelles

        risky, and very limited treatment option more than 50 years ago is now routinely
        performed in many countries worldwide. The number of renal transplants is
        expected to rise sharply in the next decade since the proportion of patients
        with end stage renal disease is increasing. \n\nAre you interested in clinical
        kidney, pancreas and islet transplantation? If you are a (bio) medical student
        or a health care professional who works in the (pre) clinical transplant field

        in the research and knowledge on clinical transplantation. The course will
        be taught by a multidisciplinary team of transplant professionals and will
        give you the state of the art updates. \n\nIt is divided in 4 modules: \n1)
        Before the transplant \n2) The surgical procedures and the challenged patient,
        including the patient with diabetes \n3) Early challenges \n4) Late challenges
        after transplantation. \n\nThe offered modules will include lectures, interactive

        Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\", and is available from Amazon,
        Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. \n\nThe course
        material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and
        can be taken either before or after such classes.\n\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh,
        Ph.D.\nProfessor\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\nDuke University\n
        www.duke.edu/~jmgroh\n\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process
        spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain''s spatial
        codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent
        book entitled \"Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\" (Harvard
        University Press, fall 2014).\n\nMuch of her research concerns differences
        in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences
        hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions
        are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction
        we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings
        challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain
        separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism
        for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the
        capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\n\nDr.
        Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her
        undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying
        neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University
        of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr.
        Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception
        and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the
        Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences
        at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology
        and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\n\nDr. Groh’s research has been supported

        Global Health is a comprehensive introduction to global health. It is meant
        to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand
        ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get
        sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which
        people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can
        be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as
        possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage
        but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor,
        and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course
        to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and
        health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key
        concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourse
        Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the course, learners should be able to:\n\n•\tArticulate
        key public health concepts related to global health;\n•\tAnalyze the key issues
        in global health from a number of perspectives;\t\n•\tDiscuss with confidence
        the burden of disease in various regions of the world; how it varies by sex,
        age, and location; key risk factors for this burden; and how the disease burden
        can be addressed in cost-effective ways;\n•\tAssess key health disparities,
        especially as they relate to the health of low-income and marginalized people
        in low- and middle-income countries; \n•\tOutline the key actors and organizations
        in global health and the manner in which they cooperate to address critical
        global health concerns;\n•\tReview key global health challenges that are likely
        to arise in the coming decades.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nValue
        Added of the Course\n\nThe course seeks to add special value by being comprehensive,
        by handling each  topic in a consistent framework, and by helping learners
        gain an understanding of well grounded approaches to assessing global health
        issues and what can be done to address them.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe
        Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health\n\nFor almost
        every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see: \n\n- Required
        readings\n- Recommended readings\n- Recommended videos\n\nWe have selected
        a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding
        the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.\n\nFor
        each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read
        the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nIn
        addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful
        to your understanding the content of each session. \n\nThe first is a textbook,
        Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook
        that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course.
        We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read.
        Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of
        the course.\n\nThe second set of “recommended readings” is some additional
        readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have
        indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of
        the material you should focus your attention.\n\nLearners should note that
        to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet,
        if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they
        are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of
        its free articles.\n\nWe have also indicated for most sessions one or two
        videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the
        learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners
        will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/56/cec920743511e6a700694a0bb599ac/Yale_Logo.jpg","id":"LD8hNEdxEeaDoBKORUcroQ","slug":"essentials-global-health","name":"Essentials

        the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders
        of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion

        that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices,
        mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early
        in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and

        las regiones del mundo se enfrentan a vulnerabilidades concretas ante el cambio
        climático y tienen diversas oportunidades de mitigar los efectos y aumentar
        su resiliencia en el siglo XXI. La comunidad internacional ha expresado su
        intención de actuar al respecto mediante el Acuerdo de París en la 21ª Conferencia
        de las Partes en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio
        Climático. De hecho, décadas de avances en desarrollo se ven amenazadas si
        no se adoptan medidas contra el cambio climático, lo que significa que nos
        encontramos en un momento de «ahora o nunca». Este curso presenta las pruebas
        científicas más recientes sobre el cambio climático, explica los distintos
        efectos de alcance regional y difunde estrategias de acción contra el cambio
        climático, así como oportunidades para que pueda tomar medidas en relación
        con el cambio climático.\n\nAcerca del curso\n\nEste MOOC orientado a la acción
        le brindará la oportunidad de conocer los efectos del cambio climático a escala
        regional y las estrategias sectoriales específicas utilizadas para aumentar
        la resiliencia y avanzar hacia un futuro con bajas emisiones de carbono. Tendrá

        Partes.\nPrograma del curso\n\nDescripción \n\nBajemos la temperatura: La
        ciencia climática pasa a la acción se divide en cuatro semanas. En las primeras
        dos semanas se presentará una visión global de las pruebas científicas del
        cambio climático, que irá seguida de perspectivas específicas de cada región
        sobre los efectos de un aumento de la temperatura en el mundo en el siglo
        XXI. Las últimas dos semanas se centrarán en las estrategias de acción emprendidas
        en distintas regiones y países para abordar el desafío climático, y sobre
        cómo puede actuar la población de manera individual.\n\nSemana 1:  El cambio
        climático en el siglo XXI\n\n•\tCambios históricos y previstos observados
        en el sistema climático en los últimos años del siglo XXI.\n•\tEl potencial
        de contribución prevista determinada a nivel nacional (CPDN) presentada en
        la 21ª Conferencia de las Partes por parte de 187 países para inducir a la
        acción climática.\n•\tTendencias de los efectos del cambio climático, entre
        otros la pérdida de la capa de hielo del Ártico, el deshielo de los glaciares,
        el aumento de las olas de calor y las temperaturas extremas, la sequía y la
        aridez. \n•\tLas posibles respuestas de los sistemas naturales, explicando
        cómo el calentamiento podría dar lugar al aumento del nivel del mar, a olas
        de calor y temperaturas extremas, y a la acidificación de los océanos.\n\nSemana
        2: Efectos de alcance sectorial y regional\n\n•\tRepercusiones en sectores
        clave del desarrollo —desde el calentamiento por encima de la temperatura
        de la época preindustrial y tendencias climáticas previstas— en cada una de
        las regiones del mundo.\n•\tRepercusiones sectoriales centradas en la producción
        agrícola, los recursos hídricos, los servicios de los ecosistemas y la vulnerabilidad
        de las zonas costeras para las poblaciones afectadas. \n•\tImportancia de
        los riesgos que pueden invertir los logros de desarrollo obtenidos con tanto
        esfuerzo y atrapar en la pobreza a millones de personas, ilustrando la necesidad
        de actuar ya con urgencia.\n\nSemana 3: La ciencia climática pasa a la acción
        en materia de cambio climático\n\n•\tDebates sobre regiones específicas en
        torno a las acciones de mitigación necesarias para reducir las emisiones a
        la vez que se disminuye la vulnerabilidad ante los efectos del cambio climático
        por medio de la adaptación y el aumento de la resiliencia al clima.\n•\tPerspectivas
        de expertos regionales sobre sus experiencias con estrategias y acciones propuestas
        en cada región para contribuir a la transición hacia una senda de desarrollo
        con bajas emisiones y resiliente al clima. \n\nSemana 4: Qué puede hacer\n\n•\tEfecto
        transformador de los cambios diarios a escala mundial\n•\tLa razón de actuar
        ahora, actuar juntos y actuar de un modo diferente\n•\tEjemplos y beneficios
        esperados de las políticas de mitigación y adaptación, teniendo en cuenta
        las contribuciones a las reducciones de las emisiones a escala mundial y las
        oportunidades de desarrollo a escala local\n\nAparte de los principales recursos

        just write poems when you can write better ones? This course is built on the
        notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is
        specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself
        is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the
        way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break
        new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert
        of voices and music.\n\nThough any of us may have the potential to make that
        happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition
        can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if
        we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). \n\nWe''ll cover
        key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and
        contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new
        poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will
        have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your
        work, working towards a more polished poem.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d2/54cc3088bc11e588558b26396cd2c9/Kearney_Course_Logo_square.jpg","name":"Sharpened

        of these courts and tribunals, and some of the challenges and prospects that
        they face. Three cross-cutting themes tie together all of these modules: (i)
        The interaction between law and politics; (ii) The continuing role of State

        the public interest and global values.\n\nThis course offers you an opportunity
        to gain a better insight into the functions and features of the courts and
        tribunals present in The Hague. You will gain a familiarity with each court

        Paradoxes of War teaches us to understand that war is not only a normal part

        that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions
        and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically
        an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted
        and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and
        sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing
        the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn
        about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday
        social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve
        to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and

        and logical interpretation. It is an invitation to think critically and historically,
        and it wants to give you a glimpse of what it means to be a historian at work.
        \n\nWe are convinced that the three Roosevelts – the 3Rs, as we will refer
        to them throughout this course – profoundly shaped the twentieth century.
        This course shows you why we think so and which paradigms, ideas, and sources
        we use to uphold our claim. But this course also asks you to give your opinion,
        and ground it on your own research findings. \n\nThe structure of the course
        is straightforward: \n- An introductory module gives you the biographical
        information you need to connect the personal stories of the 3Rs with the major
        events of the twentieth century;\n-  Module 2 explains how the 3Rs reframed
        our thinking on security, broadening its meaning and reconfiguring the government’s
        role in providing it; \n- Module 3, focusing on equality, shows how the 3Rs
        changed the relationship between leaders and led, rejected laissez-faire economics,
        and supported a politics of intervention to overcome the inequalities that
        undermined social cohesion;\n- Module 4 describes how the 3Rs promoted and
        protected the freedom of ordinary citizens, and communicated that as one of
        their central political goals;\n- Module 5 summarizes the long-lasting legacies
        of the 3Rs, and asks for your opinion on the Rooseveltian century. Do you
        agree with this interpretation of our recent past – and our possible futures?\n\nThe
        five modules contain quizzes to test your knowledge and understanding, discussion

        vie morale repliée sur elle-même à partir d’une éthique minimale : « fais
        ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en péril la liberté des autres ».
        Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied : défendre l’idée d’une éthique qui
        nous plonge dans notre réalité sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables
        et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de
        ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout réinventer.\nC’est pourquoi

        perspectives éthiques traversant le monde contemporain : l’éthique des vertus
        (ou perfectionnisme) ; l’éthique du devoir (ou déontologisme) ; l’éthique
        utilitariste (ou conséquentialisme) ; l’éthique de l’amour (ou éthique du
        don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l’ordre dans ses idées, repérer les différentes
        manières de s’orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les différences d’appréciation
        face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.\n\nQuels que

        grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions
        plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but : clarifier les idées

        everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant,
        from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical
        debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex
        world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life
        issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution
        of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted
        to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: \"do what you
        want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others\". We propose
        to go against this trend and to defend the idea of ​​an ethics that immerses
        us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus
        reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to
        say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will
        offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives
        of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty
        (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or
        ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her
        ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand
        a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives.
        Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or
        personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis.
        Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical
        thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary
        issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in
        order to better understand reality and orient human action.\n\n- - - - - -

        жителей Кёнигсберга была распространена такая практическая головоломка: можно
        ли пройти по всем мостам через реку Преголя, не проходя ни по одному из них
        дважды? В 1736 году выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер заинтересовался задачей
        и в письме другу привел строгое доказательство того, что сделать это невозможно.
        В том же году он доказал замечательную формулу, которая связывает число вершин,
        граней и ребер многогранника в трехмерном пространстве. Формула таинственным
        образом верна и для графов, которые называются \"планарными\". Эти два результата
        заложили основу теории графов и неплохо иллюстрируют направление ее развития
        по сей день. \n\nГраф как математический объект оказался полезным во многих
        теоретических и практических задачах. Наверное, дело в том, что сложность
        его структуры хорошо отвечает возможностям нашего мозга: это структура наглядная
        и понятно устроенная, но, с другой стороны, достаточно богатая, чтобы улавливать
        многие нетривиальные явления. Если говорить о приложениях, то, конечно, сразу
        же на ум приходят большие сети: Интернет, карта дорог, покрытие мобильной
        связи и т.п. В основах поисковых машин, таких, как Yandex и Google, лежат
        алгоритмы на графах. Помимо computer science, графы активно используются в
        биоинформатике, химии, социологии.\n\nЭтот курс служит введением в современную
        теорию графов. Мы, конечно, обсудим классические задачи, но и поговорим про
        более недавние результаты и тенденции, например, про экстремальную теорию
        графов. \n\nМатериал изложен с самых основ и на доступном языке. Целью этого
        курса является не только познакомить вас с вопросами и методами теории графов,
        но и развить у неподготовленных слушателей культуру математического мышления.
        Поэтому курс доступен широкому кругу слушателей. Для освоения материала будет
        достаточно знания математики на хорошем школьном уровне и базовых знаний комбинаторики.\n\nКурс
        состоит из 7 учебных недель и экзамена. Для успешного решения большинства
        задач из тестов достаточно освоить материал, рассказанный на лекциях. На семинарах
        разбираются и более сложные задачи, которые смогут заинтересовать слушателя,

        (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable landscape of
        urban infrastructure services provision. The result is an increasing interest
        in the transitioning of cities towards so-called “smart cities”- an interest
        expressed both by technology vendors and public authorities. Although such
        “smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and for
        service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban
        infrastructure service provision.\n\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough
        understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with “smart urban
        infrastructures” as well as how these infrastructures can be managed in order
        to deliver desirable performance in cities. More precisely, throughout this
        5-week MOOC you will learn about the most important principles for the management
        of smart urban infrastructures as well as about the application of these principles
        to two specific sectors, namely urban transportation and urban energy systems.
        \n\nThe course does not have any pre-requisits. However, in order to make
        the best of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our previous
        MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures which has been widely appraised
        by learners. \n\nThrough this course, students will:\n- Gain a deep understanding
        of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure
        systems;\n- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies that are and can be used
        for “smart infrastructure” solutions in cities, while effectively managing
        the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart systems;\n- Learn about
        the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems
        to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and\n-
        Understand the potential applications of the materials learned in this course,
        within the context of the management of “smart urban transportation systems”
        as well as “smart urban energy systems”.\n\nClass workload: 2 hours / week","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bf/5110902cc111e6b57a4f4a1bd67e5c/SmartCities.jpg","id":"AHvXwCwKEeaMjA6stS_New","slug":"smart-cities","name":"Smart

        how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and
        how investors approach infrastructure investments! \n\nAccording to the OECD,
        the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity
        generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals
        to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World
        GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020,
        Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments.
        Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation
        of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros
        for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy
        transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and
        construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and
        181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the
        targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally
        investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However,
        severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by
        public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors
        in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach
        infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments.
        \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the
        most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments.
        The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students
        to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the
        end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction,
        identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for
        deal structuring from a financial advisor''s perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe
        course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest
        speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible
        to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed
        to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired
        outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material,

        the previous one, so we strongly suggest you follow the sequence we''ve outlined
        rather than skip ahead or do the course in less time. The course is designed
        to give you an opportunity to learn and share with others, not test what you
        know. There are weekly activity and reflection assignments, but these will
        not be graded. To receive credit for this course, you will need to complete
        the peer-reviewed final assignment.\n\nAs a participant, you will:\n- Watch
        videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium''s approach

        течение жизни мы постоянно взаимодействуем с другими людьми. Маленькие дети,
        пытаясь добиться того, чтобы родители купили понравившуюся конфетку, часто
        шантажируют родителей своими слезами. Принимая решение заплакать, ребенок
        рискует — он не знает, как поведут себя папа с мамой. В чуть более взрослом
        возрасте абитуриенты, выбирающие вуз, принимают сложное решение о том, в какие
        университеты подать документы. Ошибка может стоить дорого: при неправильной
        стратегии можно оказаться в слабом университете или вообще остаться без заветного
        студенческого билета. Окончив вуз, юноши и девушки начинают искать работу.
        Перед интервью с работодателем они штудируют статьи в интернете о том, что
        можно и чего нельзя говорить на интервью, — они пытаются найти наилучшую стратегию
        своего поведения, исходя из ожиданий компании, в которую они устраиваются.
        Все эти ситуации объединяет то, что решения, которые принимают одни люди,
        оказывают влияние на других людей. Такие взаимодействия называются стратегическими.
        Именно их изучает теория игр.\n\nЧтобы проанализировать ту или иную реальную
        жизненную ситуацию стратегического взаимодействия и найти оптимальный вариант
        поведения в ней, необходимо сделать две вещи. Во-первых, необходимо формально
        записать ситуацию на языке теории игр, то есть создать модель (игру). Во-вторых,
        после того как модель (игра) составлена, ее необходимо решить. Этому мы будем
        учиться в течение курса. Мы разберем основные виды игр (одновременные и последовательные,
        с совершенной и несовершенной информацией, коалиционные и некоалиционные),
        приведем способы их решения и обсудим их на многочисленных примерах.\n\nКурс
        будет интересен желающим разобраться в том, как конкурируют друг с другом
        несколько компаний и можно ли гарантированно выиграть в шашки, есть ли смысл

        Требуется ли предварительная подготовка для прохождения курса?\nО: Курс является
        базовым, поэтому он не требует специальной подготовки. Для его успешного освоения
        достаточно уверенных знаний курса математики в объеме школьной программы.
        В одном-двух примерах могут пригодиться знания начал математического анализа
        (дифференцирование функций одной переменной, необходимое условие экстремума)
        и знания начал теории вероятностей (понятие математического ожидания случайной
        величины).\n\nВ: Что требуется для успешного окончания курса?\nО: Итоговая
        оценка за курс складывается из результатов 10 оцениваемых тестов. Для успешного
        окончания курса необходимо дать не менее 80 % правильных ответов на каждый

        is a powerful approach for teaching students to develop mathematical concepts
        and skills. This methodology is not about teaching a specific problem-solving
        skill to students; it’s about students using problem-solving and collaboration
        skills to develop their mathematical skills and solidify their identities
        as capable problem-solvers.\nProblem-solving is an instructional approach
        used widely in other countries and is currently helping to inform the instructional
        approaches many educators are developing to meet the demands of rigorous state
        math standards. Problem-solving is designed to create interest in mathematics
        and stimulate creative mathematical activity while supporting student collaboration
        in the classroom. A typical lesson starts with a problem, then might progress
        as follows:\n•\tFirst, students work individually to solve a problem using
        their own mathematical knowledge. \n•\tThen, students discuss various approaches
        and solutions with each other while the teacher listens closely to the strategies
        being used.\n•\tLastly, the teacher facilitates a whole-class discussion to
        compare student approaches and solutions in a progression leading toward grade-level
        standards.\nAccording to Dr. Akihiko Takahashi from DePaul University, “The
        whole-class activity provides students with opportunities to develop their
        mathematical abilities including conceptual and procedural understanding.”
        Over time, students also develop critical qualities, such as perseverance
        and independence.\nIn this Exploration, you will design a lesson that provides
        students with the opportunities to understand mathematical content while supporting
        them to become independent learners and problem-solvers.\n•\tIn the Plan/Prepare
        section, you will select a math problem for students to solve and plan a lesson
        using the problem-solving approach.\n•\tIn the Teach/Assess section, you will
        refine your lesson plan and include ways to assess the effectiveness of the
        content objective and the learning process.\n•\tIn the Analyze/Reflect section,
        you will evaluate what worked and identify any challenges you may have encountered.
        You’ll also reflect on the next steps of how you can continue to build upon
        what you’ve learned.\nThrough the Discussion Group for this Exploration, you’ll
        share questions, reflections, and resources with other teachers who are teaching
        math through problem-solving.\nSuccessful completion of this Exploration includes:\n•\tRegular
        weekly participation during the 8 weeks.\n•\tPosting in the Plan/Prepare,

        with National Arts Strategies, this course is designed to help arts and culture
        leaders create an environment where new ideas are constantly created, shared,
        evaluated and the best ones are successfully put to work.\n\nOne of the toughest
        challenges for any leader is getting traction for new ideas. Winning support
        can be a struggle. As a result, powerful new ideas often get stuck. This is
        especially true in the cultural sector. People involved in arts and culture
        often have little time and even less money for experimentation and risks.
        This course will help those in the performing arts, museums, zoos, libraries
        and other cultural organizations build environments where new management and
        program ideas flourish.\n\nLeading Innovation in Arts & Culture will teach
        you how to make an \"innovation strategy\" a fundamental component of your
        organization''s overall strategy. In this seminar you will learn to:\n\n-
        Analyze constraints on innovation in your organization, foresee obstacles
        and opportunities, and develop a shared vision\n- Develop a process to manage
        the demands of multiple stakeholders, shifting priorities and the uncertainty
        inherent in new initiatives\n- Create a culture for innovation and risk-taking
        that generates new perspectives and challenges existing practice\n- Create
        a strong customer focus within your organization that anticipates customer
        needs\n\nNational Arts Strategies worked with David Owens to customize this
        course for those working in the cultural sector. They based their work on
        David Owens’ Leading Strategic Innovation in Organizations course. This highly
        interactive 8-week course will engage you in a series of class discussions

        has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes
        headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary
        citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important
        threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean?
        What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom
        and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact
        of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage
        to scare us?\n\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressed
        in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence
        of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an
        exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The second
        part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies.
        Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise
        in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions
        and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding
        terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and
        compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance
        or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and
        possibilities for policy making.\n\nTestimonials of students who completed
        this course:\n\nI''ve been studying one particular aspect of the field for
        about fifteen years now, but lacked the sort of wider context that this course
        has provided. And I''ve made contacts here that I hope will develop into friendships.\n-Charles
        Cameron, 69, Blogger Religious Studies, UK\n\nThis has been a wonderfully
        enriching experience. I have learned a lot, and have especially appreciated
        the worldwide perspectives of the class found in the discussion forum. Being
        in this class has helped me open up the subject to discussion with colleagues
        and friends, which has led to interesting and insightful conversations. The
        class materials were effective and polished. The peer reviewed assignments
        were challenging and fun. This was my first MOOC, but certainly not my last!  \n-Joella
        Givens, 50, GIS Manager at a state government Department of Transportation,
        USA\n\nThe theoretical aspect was similar to the one offered by well respected
        universities for introductory courses on terrorism. For just 5 weeks, I think
        this course covered a lot of ground. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the discussion
        forums. (...)In addition, I found excellent recommendations on books, articles,
        documentaries, all of great quality.\n-Arete Ketekidou, 32, Research/Analyst,
        Greece\n\nI like very much the freedom we have to study, this is the best
        incentive, not only because we can express our ideas on forums freely and
        manage our own time, also because Professor Bakker has not been imposing his

        journey of Implant Dentistry by exploring how discoveries in biology and technological
        developments lead to the current practice of dental implants. Then, we will
        examine clinical cases, diagnose our patients’ needs and expectations and
        learn the principles of treatment planning. We will learn step-by-step surgical
        procedures for placing implants and various restorative techniques, directed
        by current evidence and best practices. Finally, we will investigate major
        threats and complications of implant procedures and ways to ensure successful
        treatments and long serving implants.\n\nWhat is the aim of the course?\nThis
        MOOC has a strong clinical focus and is especially designed to enhance professional
        learning among dental practitioners and dental students. The course aims to

        такое физика и зачем она нужна? Некоторые люди никогда не задаются таким вопросом.
        Некоторые считают, что физика нужна исключительно для создания различных «девайсов»,
        например холодильников или мобильных телефонов. И они в чем-то правы, ведь
        сказал же Оскар Уайльд, что «Комфорт – это единственное, что может нам дать
        цивилизация».\n\nДля нас физика – это умение видеть и понимать окружающий
        мир, возможность творить то, о чем раньше даже и мечтать было сложно. Мы считаем,
        что для дальнейшего прогресса человечества необходимы ученые-физики, инженеры-физики
        и просто образованные люди. Мы готовы делиться нашими знаниями. \n\nПредлагаемый
        курс «Электростатика и магнитостатика» посвящен рассмотрению ключевых понятий
        этой области: уравнений Максвелла, записанных в статическом случае как внутри
        вещества, так и вне его, энергетических подходов для вычисления сил, действующих
        на объекты, находящиеся электростатическом или магнитном поле, а также рассмотрение
        свойств для постоянных токов.\n\nСразу заметим – курс не очень простой, для
        его освоения слушателям необходимо владеть знаниями по физике в объеме школьной
        программы, основами дифференциального и интегрального исчисления и основами
        векторного исчисления.\n\nВ течение 10 недель вам будут предлагаться для изучения
        видеолекции, физические демонстрации и семинары с разбором задач. Основные
        формулы и тезисы лекций представлены в виде кратких конспектов. Каждая учебная
        неделя содержит тест и 4 задачи для самостоятельного решения. Экзаменационные

        curso persigue adentrarse en la realidad del trabajo de un alto ejecutivo:
        lo qué hace y cómo lo hace. Es un hecho conocido que la mayoría de altos directivos
        dedican hasta el 90% de su tiempo al día a día y menos del 10% a las tareas
        asociadas al pensamiento estratégico en la organización. Por eso es importante
        ir más allá y entender las prioridades que configuran esta actuación diaria.
        Al final, la mejor estrategia es aquella que se practica; la mejor organización,
        aquella que funciona; y el quehacer cotidiano coherente con las prioridades
        establecidas, la base de la continuidad con éxito de las empresas. \n\nEl
        objetivo del curso es aportar una visión estructurada de cómo logran este
        objetivo los “buenos directivos”, con la voluntad de que sirva a futuros altos
        ejecutivos a orientar mejor su carrera, a enfocar sus actividades y a desarrollar
        su propio estilo de dirección.\n\nEl curso profundiza en las prioridades de
        la Alta Dirección a partir de la actuación diaria de directivos de probada
        valía y con éxito profesional en empresas diversas. \n\nEl contenido está
        basado en los resultados de las entrevistas personales que hemos realizado
        a más de 200 directores generales de compañías muy diversas. Gran parte de
        este material ha quedado recogido en los libros publicados “Qué hacen los
        buenos directivos. El reto del siglo XXI”  y “Yo Dirijo”, cuya lectura recomendamos
        a todo aquel que desee ampliar su perspectiva sobre esta materia.\n\nEl modelo
        que se propugna en curso es el resultado de una amplia investigación empírica;
        no es una doctrina, sino un instrumento mental para ayudar a construir una
        configuración empresarial que potencie el hacer de la gente para que, sin
        dejación de su derecho a ser felices y a la autonomía, logren su plenitud

        live in challenging times for teachers. The challenge comes from the virtual
        tsunami of pressures building on education systems to respond to the digital
        revolution.  Workplaces are also changing as a result of the shift to the
        knowledge economy. One thing is clear – our students (and us) need a different
        set of basic skills. Of course the 3R’s – reading, writing and arithmetic
        – remain important, but so are the 4C’s, critical thinking, creativity, communication
        and collaboration. And we all need meta-cognitive skills, to sustain learning
        through life.\n\nThis MOOC takes a teachers’ perspective. It canvasses the
        21st century skills students need. It explores how teachers might apply developmental
        teaching and assessment principles to develop these skills in a classroom.
        \n\nIn this MOOC you will work through two detailed examples of 21st century
        skills, examining how they can be taught and assessed. The first is collaborative
        problem solving, a 21st century skill which combines the capacities of collaboration,
        problem solving, critical thinking and communication. The second skill is
        a meta-cognitive skill of knowing how to learn in a MOOC. In each example,
        you will explore how to understand the nature of each skill from a teaching
        perspective, how to teach it, and how to assess it. These two examples show
        how any 21st century skill can be tackled in the classroom. \n\nAND as far
        as possible on a MOOC platform, the course itself has been re-designed to
        model developmental teaching, so that you can experience the type of teaching
        from us, that your students will need from you, if they are to be equipped
        with 21st century skills.\nWe are delighted to be offering this MOOC again.

        cash flow method means that we can find firm value by discounting future cash
        flows of a firm. That is, firm value is present value of cash flows a firm
        generates in the future. In order to understand the meaning of present value,
        we are going to discuss time value of money, first. That is, the value of
        $100 today is different from the value of $100 a year later. Then, what should
        be the present value of $100 that you are going to receive in 1 year? How
        about the value of $100 dollars that you are going to receive every year for
        next 10 years? How about forever? After taking this course, you are going
        to be able to find the present value of these types of cash flows in the future.

        to use excel to find present value of future cash flows. In addition to the
        present value, you are also going to learn how to find future value given

        given interest rates, number of periods to wait given investment and interest

        depends.”  That is what you’ll hear when asking about the U.S. university
        admission process.  With over 4,000 universities in the United States and
        no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing
        for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.\n\nThis
        course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native
        English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering
        practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university
        application.  More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use
        those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can
        understand the process beyond the pieces.\n\nBy the end of this course, you
        will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating
        a school list, and establishing an application plan.  This course will not
        answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the
        right questions of yourself and the universities.  Ultimately, you will have
        all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting
        you on the path to acceptance.\n\n* Please note, while the English Language
        Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course
        about applying to Penn.  Furthermore, this course is intended for international
        students educated in the national curriculum of their country.  While other
        students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students
        or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced
        Placement curriculum.  The course is also intended for students who do not
        have access to university counseling – if you attend a school that offers
        university counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on
        applying to university.  Finally, this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors
        degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants.  Undergraduate
        transfer applicants, students who have attended a university, will find some
        of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants

        and environmental sustainability are not natural bedfellows. Business is about
        making money. Sustainability is about protecting the planet. Business is measured
        in months and quarters. Sustainability often requires significant short term
        costs to secure a sometimes uncertain long-term benefit. To some activists,
        all executives are exploitative, selfish one percenters. To some executives,
        all activists are irresponsible, unyielding extremists. \n\nAnd yet engaging
        with the issue isn’t optional – all businesses must have a strategy to deal
        with sustainability and, like any strategy, this involves making choices.
        \n\nThis Strategy and Sustainability course based on Rosenberg''s recently
        published book encourages learners to filter out the noise and make those
        choices in a hard-nosed and clear-eyed way. Prof. Rosenberg’s nuanced and
        fact-based point of view recognizes the complexity of the issues at hand and
        the strategic choices businesses must make. He blends the work of some of
        the leading academic thinkers in the field with practical examples from a
        variety of business sectors and geographies and offers a framework with which
        senior management might engage with the topic, not (just) to save the planet
        but to fulfill their short, medium and long-term responsibilities to shareholders
        and other stakeholders.\n\nThis course promises to be both engaging and thought-provoking,

        is a master course given in Moscow at the Laboratory of Algebraic Geometry
        of the National Research University Higher School of Economics by Valery Gritsenko,
        a professor of University Lille 1, France.\nJacobi forms are holomorphic functions
        in two complex variables. They are modular in one variable and abelian (or
        double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became
        an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and
        Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985)
        which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due
        to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and
        differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory
        of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course
        might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated
        undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one
        has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for
        example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic”
        are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using
        it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or
        many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor
        some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the
        course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.

        a top 50 MOOC of all time by Class Central!\n\nThis course begins a series
        of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join
        us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without
        ever needing to put on a lab coat.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we
        investigate DNA replication, and ask the question, where in the genome does
        DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many
        bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages
        in the genome.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we examine a different
        biological question, when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular
        clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but
        how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again, we will see that by
        knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the
        amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized
        algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.\n\nFinally,
        you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring
        biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium

        пользователя по его действиям в интернете, предсказание цены, по которой будет
        куплена подержанная машина.\n\nВ этом курсе вы научитесь формулировать и,
        конечно, решать такие задачи. В центре нашего внимания будут успешно применяемые
        на практике алгоритмы классификации и регрессии: линейные модели, нейронные

        клиентскую поддержку и рекрутинг) с помощью социальных медиа. \nКурс включает
        в себя 4 модуля, в рамках которых последовательно описываются цели и направления
        использования социальных платформ в рамках маркетинговых коммуникаций (1 модуль),
        раскрывается стратегическая последовательность шагов по реализации цифрового
        проекта в социальных медиа (2 модуль), предлагается тренинг деятельности в

        areas.\n\nIn this course you will learn the different phases of clinical development:\n\n*
        Phase 1 or early stage clinical trial are conducted primar­ily to determine
        how the new drug works in humans, its safety profile and to predict its dosage
        range.  It typically involves between 30 and 100 healthy volunteers.\n\n*
        Phase 2 or Proof of Concept POC studies test for efficacy as well as safety
        and side effects in a group of between 30  to 200 hundred  patients with  the
        disease for which the new drug is being developed.\n\n* Phase 3 or late stage
        clinical development involve much larger group of patients, between a few
        hundred to thousands, depending on the indication, which will  help  determine
        if the new drug can be considered both safe and effective.  It will involve
        control groups using placebo and/or current treatment as a comparison.\n\n*
        Product registration and approval process after a drug is considered safe
        and effective from Phase 3 trials, it must be authorized in each individual
        country before  it can  be  marketed. All data gen­erated about the small
        molecule or biologic is collected  and  submitted to the regulatory authorities
        in the US at the FDA, Food and Drug Administration FDA, in Europe the EMA
        or European Medicines Agency, Japan Ministry of Health and other countries

        Arguments\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important.
        This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will
        learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all
        and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how
        to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians,
        used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own
        in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will
        be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll
        four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four
        weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability.
        If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next
        session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning
        of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums
        who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be
        taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse
        1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II:
        How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse
        4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWhen
        is someone giving an argument instead of just yelling? Which parts of what
        they say contribute to the argument? Why are they arguing instead of fighting?
        What are arguments made of? What forms do they take? Think Again: How to Understand
        Arguments will answer these questions a more. \n\nIn this course, you will
        learn what an argument is. The definition of argument will enable students
        to identify when speakers are giving arguments and when they are not. Next,
        we will learn how to break an argument into its essential parts, how to put
        them in order to reveal their connections, and how to fill in gaps in an argument.
        By the end of this course, students will be better able to understand and
        appreciate arguments that they and other people present.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents
        who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to
        explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments:
        An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 1-5, by
        Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format:\nEach week
        will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately
        or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to
        check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/thinkagain/large-icon.png","id":"VIUTXB0IEea20BJooCBlFw","slug":"understanding-arguments","name":"Think

        Some of the questions you will explore this week are: What is the nonprofit
        sector and why does it exist?  What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit
        organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations
        in the nonprofit sector?\n\nWeek 2: Questions to be explored this week are:
        What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management?  What
        is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?\n\nWeek
        3: This week''s questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations?
        Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about
        their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board''s ability
        to go its work?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course
        content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board

        Beginning Game Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop
        video games using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++,
        Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard
        of? First, using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework, which
        help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and others.
        Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers,
        and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.
        And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.\n\nThat
        learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn''t
        assume you have any previous programming experience. Don''t worry if you''ve
        never written code before; we''ll start at the very beginning and work our
        way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout
        the course you''ll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming
        languages, including C#, and you''ll also learn how to apply those concepts
        when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating
        the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound
        effects in your games, and so on.\n\nComputer programming is really fun in
        general, and programming games is even better!\n\nCaution: Beginning (assuming
        no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do).
        Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since this course is essentially
        a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master

        been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the
        new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much
        larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug
        to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication
        to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug
        in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any,
        may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early
        as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market''s needs are incorporated
        into the new drug''s overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results
        are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy
        is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community

        of this course is to encourage a critical understanding of doping. To achieve
        this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow
        you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different
        perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow
        us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.\n\nDoping in sports
        is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of
        socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers to shed light
        on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances.
        Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping
        which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes
        selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These
        apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions,
        doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. \nIn efforts to control
        doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions
        responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also
        what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This
        course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological
        passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as
        well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides the Professors of
        University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course:
        experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the
        CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the

        Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able
        to :\n\n1.\tIdentify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical
        practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary
        way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity
        of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all
        at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices
        of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational
        context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced

        Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to
        develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious
        endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving
        disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning
        opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational
        field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science
        learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring
        STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high
        and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that
        supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the
        Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both
        children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning
        many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art,
        science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by
        investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them.
        This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one,
        particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects
        in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which
        offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course,
        we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve
        into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific
        materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll
        also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed
        that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school
        science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope
        this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis
        is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential!
        We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking
        questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is
        a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the
        world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although
        this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great
        deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration.
        We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations
        and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark
        interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a
        requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague
        or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities
        with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED
        COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly
        course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium
        store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible,
        well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow

        course will allow you to identify and evaluate opportunities for creating
        a tech business, and to better understand its principal issues on a human,
        technical, commercial, environmental and financial level.\n\nAs such, you
        will obtain solid foundations either for building your own tech business,
        or for joining one.\n\nDeciding to create or to join a tech business in these
        early years is an out-of-the-ordinary adventure, and it certainly won’t be
        straightforward: you need to be ready to accept that not all \"good\" ideas
        will lead to success, and that only a very small number of projects lead to
        great success. You must learn to overhaul your relationship with failure,
        which is a valuable source of experience and should be managed according to
        the logic of “acceptable loss”: the entrepreneur loves uncertainty, not excessive
        risk. The creation of tech businesses gives you a genuine opportunity to change
        the world, but requires you to adopt a particular state of mind and to be
        able to acquire knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills.\n\nYou will
        have the chance to work alongside passionate and exciting people from a whole
        multitude of backgrounds. From a technological point of view, these women
        and men have constructed numerous companies of a global scale.\n\nThe development
        trajectory of a tech business is full of mishaps which require you to be both
        agile and greatly prepared to build on a strong idea, choose your market,
        develop your proposal, assemble a team worthy of the task in hand, and finding
        financing.\n\nThe course is made up of methodological sessions as well as
        first-hand accounts from entrepreneurs and people who have succeeded in creating
        tech businesses themselves. You will thus be able to get to know the essential
        dilemmas with which high-tech business creators are confronted with, beginning
        with the initial decision to set up your very own structure, which itself
        represents a significant life decision.\n\nYou will also see that the creation
        of a tech business is much more a collective adventure than an individual

        Study: Recommending Products\n\nHow does Amazon recommend products you might
        be interested in purchasing?  How does Netflix decide which movies or TV shows
        you might want to watch?  What if you are a new user, should Netflix just
        recommend the most popular movies?  Who might you form a new link with on
        Facebook or LinkedIn?  These questions are endemic to most service-based industries,
        and underlie the notion of collaborative filtering and the recommender systems
        deployed to solve these problems.  In this fourth case study, you will explore
        these ideas in the context of recommending products based on customer reviews.  \n\nIn
        this course, you will explore dimensionality reduction techniques for modeling
        high-dimensional data.  In the case of recommender systems, your data is represented
        as user-product relationships, with potentially millions of users and hundred
        of thousands of products.  You will implement matrix factorization and latent
        factor models for the task of predicting new user-product relationships.  You
        will also use side information about products and users to improve predictions.\n\nLearning
        Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Create a collaborative
        filtering system.\n   -Reduce dimensionality of data using SVD, PCA, and random
        projections.\n   -Perform matrix factorization using coordinate descent.\n   -Deploy

        course will introduce you to some of the main areas of research in contemporary
        philosophy. Each module a different philosopher will talk you through some
        of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We’ll
        begin by trying to understand what philosophy is – what are its characteristic
        aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we’ll spend
        the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different
        areas of philosophy. \n\nTopics you’ll learn about will include: \n\nEpistemology,
        where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists
        in, and how we come to have it;\n\nPhilosophy of science, where we’ll investigate
        foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;\n\nPhilosophy
        of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have
        a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;\n\nMoral Philosophy,
        where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions
        – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or
        cultural preferences, and;\n\nMetaphysics, where we’ll think through some
        fundamental conceptual questions about the nature of reality.\n\nThe development
        of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh''s Eidyn research

        платформы можно уподобить волшебной сцене, где каждый желающий, используя
        готовый реквизит и подмостки, может поставить свою постановку почти бесплатно
        и пригласить зрителей-юзеров с неплохими шансами превратить их в друзей бренда.
        Вы можете разыграть целое представление по вовлечению пользователя в Ваш бизнес.
        \nТеперь каждый предприниматель, используя инструменты инфографики, цифрового
        дизайна, контент- и комьюнити-менеджмента, может стать одновременно драматургом-сценаристом,
        режиссёром, художником-декоратором и актёром  шоу, разыгрываемого перед цифровой
        публикой. \nНаш курс как раз об этом – как сделать так, чтобы Ваша цифровая
        бизнес-постановка снискала успех у зрителя, голосующего за неё звонкой монетой.
        В каком-то смысле это курс драматургии и режиссёрского мастерства, но не обычного,
        а цифрового. \nВ наших лекциях мы расскажем Вам о новом герое этой сцены –
        коллаборативной социалномике или экономике участия, новом зрителе – аудитории
        социальных платформ, новых подмостках – многообразии социальных платформ,
        о том, что происходит за кулисами - как «мониторят» социальные сети,  о новой
        режиссуре как построении стратегии присутствия и продвижения в социальных
        сетях и новой игре, актерах и помощниках сцены – дизайнерах, копирайтерах,
        контент- и комьюнити-менеджерах.\nКурс является составной частью общей специализации
        «Цифровой SMM-проект: виртуальная платформа для бизнес-коммуникаций», посвящен

        вероятностей - это, вне всякого сомнения, один из самых важных и богатых приложениями
        разделов современной математики.\n\nС помощью методов этой замечательной науки
        можно как оценивать классические вероятности выигрышных стратегий в азартных
        играх, так и решать весьма серьезные прикладные задачи, возникающие буквально
        в каждой области науки. В нашем курсе мы познакомим слушателей прежде всего
        с самыми основами предмета. И сделаем мы это в уникальном формате - иллюстрируя
        вероятностные объекты и методы на примерах решения с их помощью комбинаторных
        задач. Суть в том, что, конечно, в базовой вероятности много комбинаторики,
        и это все знают; мы же расскажем не только об этом, но и о том, как, наоборот,
        вероятностные методы позволяют работать с комбинаторными задачами. Это позволит
        нам впоследствии выйти на приложения вероятности в теории графов, случайных
        графов и, наконец, веб-графов и прочих сложных сетей. Также в рамках курса
        мы оторвемся от чисто комбинаторных интерпретаций и обсудим более общие вероятностные
        модели. Но интуиция все равно сохранится, и в этой комбинаторной подоплеке
        уникальность курса.\n\nКурс построен так, что будет по плечу даже тем, кто
        изучал математику последний раз только в школе. Тем не менее, так как для
        понимания курса необходимы знания основ комбинаторики, мы рекомендуем пройти
        наш курс по комбинаторике прежде чем прослушивать данный курс.\n\nВнутри курса
        также все просто – каждую неделю вас ждут видеолекции и проверочные задания,
        которые нужно выполнять в срок. В конце – итоговая проверочная работа. Студенты,

        считывают данные о внешнем мире с разнообразных датчиков, обрабатывают информацию,
        получают и отправляют данные на ПК, в Интернет, на мобильные устройства, управляют
        индикацией и движением. Создание устройств будет включать проектирование,
        изучение компонентов, сборку схем, написание программ, диагностику. Попутно
        с созданием самих устройств вы сделаете визуализацию на ПК, создадите веб-страницу,
        которую будет демонстрировать одно из ваших устройств, а также разберетесь
        с устройством и работой FDM 3D-принтера. \n\nПомимо тех, кто увлекается робототехникой
        или стремится расширить кругозор и свои навыки, курс будет полезен всем, кто
        сталкивается с задачами бытовой и производственной автоматизации, а также

        nós negociamos diariamente. No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família,
        proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários,
        entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma
        empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa,
        as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.\n\nEste curso
        fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que
        podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios.
        O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento,
        (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. \n\nCada
        estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para
        responder em negociações futuras, como:  \n•\tQuais são os principais elementos
        em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta
        de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?\n•\tQue
        diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?\n•\tQual é
        a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?\n•\tQuais
        ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas
        psicológicas devem ser evitadas?\n•\tQuais são as quatro principais questões
        de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?\n•\tQuais conceitos
        e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  \n\nDurante o curso,
        você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos)
        sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões
        para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação.
        O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia
        na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica.
        \n\nDependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas
        semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos
        os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que \"É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad\".\n\nApós
        assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você
        poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações
        como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam
        os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback
        sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.\n\nThis is

        Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction\n\nIn our case study
        on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative
        sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In
        our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle
        financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for
        the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely
        used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including
        ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification.
        \n\nIn this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art
        performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most
        successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic
        regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to
        design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models
        at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique
        on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address
        significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including
        handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This
        course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations
        of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We''ve also included optional
        content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go
        even deeper! \n\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will
        be able to:\n   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.\n   -Tackle
        both binary and multiclass classification problems.\n   -Implement a logistic
        regression model for large-scale classification.  \n   -Create a non-linear
        model using decision trees.\n   -Improve the performance of any model using
        boosting.\n   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.\n   -Describe
        the underlying decision boundaries.  \n   -Build a classification model to
        predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  \n   -Analyze financial data
        to predict loan defaults.\n   -Use techniques for handling missing data.\n   -Evaluate
        your models using precision-recall metrics.\n   -Implement these techniques

        is about what we can learn from examining the human skeleton, and how we can
        use this knowledge to reconstruct the lives of people who lived in the past.
        In archaeology and anthropology, human skeletal remains can provide unique
        insights into the past and the present; insights that cannot be gained otherwise.\nThese
        insights are explored in five main themes spread out over five weeks of learning.
        First, it is shown how age-at-death, sex and stature can be estimated by the
        close examination of (archaeological) skeletal remains. In subsequent modules
        it is shown how human bones can provide information about the diseases and
        injuries that people suffered from and what they ate. Also, it is shown how
        the human skeleton provides information about the kinds of activities that
        people engaged in and about how they migrated and moved around their landscapes.
        \n\nIn this course, you will examine all aspects of the human skeleton that
        can provide us with information about these different facets of life. Together
        we will explore the scientific field that is known as human osteoarchaeology.
        \n- Human, because it is about us and our ancestors, \n- Osteo, because it
        is about our bones, \n- Archaeology, because we use this information to better
        understand the behaviors and events experienced by past people. \n\nDuring
        the course, you will decipher the clues left behind in the skeletons of past
        peoples with the methods and techniques that are presented. You may also discover
        some clues hidden in your own skeleton and what they reveal about the life

        you (or do you want to) manage employees? Have you ever wondered how to get
        better performance out of those you manage? Are you unsure if you are communicating
        effectively with your employees? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions,
        then this course – and its associated specialization – is for you!\n\nLeadership
        and management responsibilities have changed dramatically, particularly in
        the last decade. In order to be an effective manager in increasingly fast-paced
        and complex organizational environments, coaching has become essential. \n\nIn
        this course, you will learn what coaching is and learn how to differentiate
        between it and all of the other myriad roles managers are expected to perform
        – managing, mentoring, leading, and training. You’ll learn about the importance
        of strong leadership and learn to describe your current point of view as a
        leader, and evaluate when to adjust your thinking in order to be more effective
        in managing and leading in a rapidly evolving workplace.\n\nAnd finally, you’ll
        be introduced to the Thought Model, a coaching technique you can use to develop
        better thinkers and better performers. So if you’re ready to learn all about
        how to be a more effective and valued manager using coaching techniques, join

        about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother,
        student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms
        constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines
        the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health.
        We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’ and the processes
        by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics
        of different types of communities.\n\nAn appreciation of community similarities
        and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all
        interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view
        a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for
        improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources
        is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and
        philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the
        change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate
        in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.\n\nWe examine
        the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement
        may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study
        of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa
        is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully
        applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in

        are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?\n\nThis is surely one
        of life’s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our
        ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several
        Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had
        their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our
        own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil
        recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would''ve been
        forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky,
        you could''ve based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations
        with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past
        decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have
        a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis
        course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School
        of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas
        at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws
        content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and
        behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading
        a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof.
        Raj''s forthcoming book, titled If you''re so smart, why aren''t you happy?
        can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your
        leisure. \n\nFor Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book
        is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can
        order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com.
        Please mention that you are a student of the \"coursera happiness course\"
        in your email. \n\nThe course will feature guest appearances by several well-known
        thought leaders, including:\n      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational
        and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),\n      - Ed Diener (“Dr. Happiness”),\n      -
        Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),\n\nBy taking this course, you will
        discover the answers to questions such as:\n      - Why aren’t the smart-and-the-successful
        as happy as they could—or should—be\n      - What are the “7 Deadly Happiness
        Sins” that even the smart and the successful commit?, and\n      - What are
        the “7 Habits of the Highly Happy” and how can you implement them in your
        life?\n\nBy the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent
        with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of
        the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/441350c22211e4bd49df699111f70c/Wanting-to-be-happy.JPG","name":"A

        trials are experiments designed to evaluate new interventions to prevent or

        program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health
        delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider
        clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients
        or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized

        We''ll create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or ''design-y'' to instigate,
        evoke, experiment, record, explain, or to try out a media. The first two weeks
        are experimental and exploratory; we won’t be concerned with meaning or communication
        (although, to be honest, every image does exist in a context, and therefore
        communicates—or can convey—meaning, connotation, associations, and expressiveness).
        \n\nIn the second two weeks, we’ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally
        carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition,
        composition, and context. Everyone has a natural, intuitive way of putting
        things together. We’ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches
        for putting things together, composing page spreads with your images. Since
        nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the
        image’s connotations, meanings and associations generated through elements
        of composition and “visual contrasts.” through style, juxtaposition, closure
        and figures of speech. \n\nUltimately, we will take the images that you create

        тоже есть. И это является еще одним важным фактором, обуславливающим необходимость
        обращения к языковому материалу сегодня и дополнительного его изучения.\nСпецифика
        курса, который в университетской программе традиционно называется «Русский
        язык и культура речи», состоит в том, что он является общеобразовательным
        и повсеместно читается студентам самых разных факультетов. В российских вузах
        его ежегодно слушают экономисты, юристы, психологи, биологи, информатики,
        историки, спортсмены…\nВ онлайн-курсе предпринимается попытка дать базовые
        знания, необходимые для эффективного освоения дисциплины студентами различных
        направлений и специальностей как российских, так и зарубежных вузов.\nКурс
        будет интересен студентам любых факультетов и любых курсов (включая магистратуру),
        иностранным гражданам, изучающим русский язык, школьникам среднего и старшего
        звена, а также всем желающим повысить уровень владения навыками устной и письменной
        речи.\nСертификат получают слушатели, набравшие больше 70% (от 71% и выше)
        от максимально возможного количества баллов.\nПри этом итоговый результат
        складывается из следующих составляющих: промежуточные тесты дают 70 %, итоговый
        тест  дает 30 %.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bc/20f7d052df11e5b544012069a20f0b/itog.jpg","name":"Русский

        is reaching a new peak in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities.
        Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of
        concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models
        of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\n\nGeneral Overview
        Help Center\n\nUrbanization is reaching a new peak in the contemporary world
        with the rise of mega cities. Researchers try to make sense of these large
        urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and
        present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary
        developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid
        developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching
        a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond
        15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo,
        New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers
        try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such
        as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class
        will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis
        to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those
        cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what?
        Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent
        convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised
        capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening
        of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities
        are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories,
        rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account
        flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts
        developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To
        what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between
        northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute
        to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given
        current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social
        questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception
        of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing,
        differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several
        conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed
        to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of
        integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities,
        buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms
        of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts,
        senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in
        terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare,
        education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities,
        everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division
        of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions
        about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues
        about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable
        development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social
        control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll

        course examines macroeconomic performance in the short run and the long run
        based on the economy’s institutional and policy environment. The first module
        develops a model of macroeconomy in the short run when the price level has
        its own momentum and does not respond much to supply and demand forces. The
        model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined
        in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe
        second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the
        foreign exchange market. It then connects the long-run outcome with expectations
        about the future trends in the exchange rate at each moment, which constitute
        a key driver of the spot exchange rate in the short run. The methodology developed
        for this purpose can be applied to expectations concerning other macroeconomic
        variables as well. Finally, the long-run foreign exchange model is employed
        to derive a number of important lessons for the long run trends in currency
        values and competitiveness of producers in various countries.\n\nThe third
        module examines the drivers of aggregate output in the long run and the mechanisms
        of adjustment from the short run to the long run. The model provides insights
        about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies
        grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why
        inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model
        is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles
        of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the
        macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable
        macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them.
        It connects these deviations to country characteristics that one needs to
        take into account when assessing a country’s long-term macroeconomic environment.
        The module ends with a discussion of the institutional conditions that help
        bring about better fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nAt the end of this course,
        you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how the market for aggregate goods and
        services interacts with the money market to shape the macroeconomic equilibrium
        that determines income, interest rate, and exchange rate in the short run.\n•\tUnderstand
        the links between the short-run and long-run processes.\n•\tAssess the dynamic
        effects of macroeconomic policies and understand the roles of globalization,
        government policies, institutions, and expectations in macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThis

        Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important. This series of four
        short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but
        vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting
        mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze,
        and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen,
        and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help
        you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing
        with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses
        in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We
        suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for
        whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We
        also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month
        in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are
        working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently,
        we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I:
        How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse
        3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV:
        How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nImagine that a
        friend denies that modus ponens is a valid form of argument. Can you prove
        that it is valid without using modus ponens itself and thereby assuming that
        it is valid? If so, how? If not, what does this show about the validity of
        modus ponens?\n\nHow can phrases like \"and\", \"or\", \"if\", and \"not\"
        work as \"truth-functional connectives\"?\n\nIn this course, you will learn
        how to evaluate deductive arguments for validity. In particular, you will
        learn new ways of representing the information that is contained in the premises
        of a deductive argument. Using these new representational devices (devices
        that we call \"truth tables\" and \"Venn diagrams\"), we will be able to apply
        rules to determine whether or not a particular deductive argument is valid.
        \n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional
        exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult
        Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition,
        Concise, Chapters 6 and 7 by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse
        Format:\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be
        viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after
        each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end
        of the course.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/thinkagain/large-icon.png","id":"aPM0Nx7iEea8agoSdQeRvQ","slug":"deductive-reasoning","name":"Think

        graphical models (PGMs) are a rich framework for encoding probability distributions
        over complex domains: joint (multivariate) distributions over large numbers
        of random variables that interact with each other. These representations sit
        at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts
        from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more. They
        are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications,
        such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural
        language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool
        in formulating many machine learning problems. \n\nThis course is the second
        in a sequence of three. Following the first course, which focused on representation,
        this course addresses the question of probabilistic inference: how a PGM can
        be used to answer questions. Even though a PGM generally describes a very
        high dimensional distribution, its structure is designed so as to allow questions
        to be answered efficiently. The course presents both exact and approximate
        algorithms for different types of inference tasks, and discusses where each
        could best be applied. The (highly recommended) honors track contains two

        Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures

        and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial
        and scientific interests.\n\nDigital images and videos are everywhere these
        days – in thousands of scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer,
        industrial, and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range
        of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma
        rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore
        an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students,
        software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video
        processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are
        experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing
        include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g.,
        removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and
        transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos
        via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage
        and efficient transmission. \n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of

        you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video
        enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform
        these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and

        day, everybody uses language. There is no human society, no matter how small
        or how isolated, which does not employ a language that is rich and diverse.
        This course introduces you to linguistics, featuring interviews with well-known
        linguists and with speakers of many different languages. Join us to explore
        the miracles of human language!\n\nThe Miracles of Human Language introduces
        you to the many-faceted study of languages, which has amazed humans since
        the beginning of history. Together with speakers of many other languages around
        the world, as well as with famous linguists such as Noam Chomsky and Adele
        Goldberg, you will learn to understand and analyse how your native tongue
        is at the same time similar and different from many other languages. You will
        learn the basic concepts of linguistics, get to know some of the key features
        of big and small languages and get insight into what linguists do.\n\nThis
        course gives an introduction into the study of languages, the field of linguistics.
        With the support of the basic linguistic terminology that is offered in the
        course, you will soon be able to comment both on variety between languages,
        as well as on a single language’s internal structure. Anyone who wishes to
        understand how languages work, and how they can give us insight into the human
        mind is very welcome to join.\n\nThe course is useful if you want to get a
        fairly quick introduction into linguistics, for instance because you are considering
        studying it further, or because you are interested in a neighbouring discipline
        such as psychology, computer science or anthropology. Furthermore, the course
        will help you develop analytical skills.\n\nIf you are curious to understand
        how language works and how it gives insight into the human mind, this course
        is definitely for you!","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5e/72af706e7911e4858ab71800f6a19c/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel__Vienna__-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg","id":"fM5baJoUEeW93wo8Ha4kow","slug":"human-language","name":"Miracles

        Diaspora in China is a unique experience for world Jewry, as China is the
        only country in Far East that has had Jews living in its society for over
        1,000 years. Documentary evidence shows that Jews started to live in China
        no later than the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The famous Kaifeng Jewish community,
        which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty
        (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora
        in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century
        to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established
        major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish
        communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic
        and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large
        number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive?
        Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among
        them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story
        of Jews in modern China is certainly a fascinating and up-lifting one. This
        course will examine these questions and more.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/eb/326bc0b9ca11e4b3dfa100b3bca814/jews-in-china.jpg","name":"Jewish

        course provides an introduction to systems thinking and systems models in

        with many actors, institutions and risk factors involved. If an outcome depends
        on many interacting and adaptive parts and actors the outcome cannot be analyzed

        important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives

        here is give you a roadmap and framework for how financial professional make
        decisions.  \n\nWe will cover the basics of financial valuation, the time
        value of money, compounding returns, and discounting the future.  You will
        understand discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation and how it compares to other
        methods.  We also step inside the mind of a corporate financial manager and
        develop the basic tools of capital budgeting.  We will survey the how, when,
        and where to spend money, make tradeoffs about investment, growth, dividends,
        and how to ensure sound fiscal discipline.  Our journey then turns to a Wall
        Street or capital markets perspective of investments as we discuss the fundamental
        tradeoff between risk and return.  We then synthesize our discussion of risk
        with our valuation framework and incorporate it into series of direct applications
        to practice.\n\nThis course requires no prior familiarity with finance.  Rather,
        it is intended to be a first step for anyone who is curious about understanding
        stock markets, valuation, or corporate finance.  We will walk through all
        of the tools and quantitative analysis together and develop a guide for understanding
        the seemingly complex decisions that finance professionals make.  \n\nBy the
        end of the course, you will develop an understanding of the major conceptual
        levers that push and pull on financial decision making and how they relate
        to other areas of business.  The course should also serve as a roadmap for

        about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government,
        seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing
        problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and
        to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated,
        perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century,
        and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In
        many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.
        \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In
        this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions
        and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things
        to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and

        Mary Wollstonecraft, and John Stuart Mill; and more contemporary theorists

        Course FOUR!   In Modules 1-4 you will cover the final elements of the Specialization
        necessary to round out this introduction to the fundamentals of Photography,
        and prepare you for creating your own exciting project in the Capstone!  You
        have come a long way since the beginning of this journey from Smartphone Basics
        to DSLR and Beyond.  Just think of all the information you have absorbed and
        put to use in your assignments and quizzes, and the confidence you have gained
        that you CAN control the camera to make pictures you are proud to share.  \n\nHere
        in Course Four you will start by gaining knowledge related to content in photography,
        from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive.  Next you will learn
        principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light
        in Ambient/Natural settings.  \n\nThe flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in
        to your camera or an add-on \"hotshoe\" model, will finally be something you,
        not the camera, controls!  You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries
        of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious,
        as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various
        situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity
        to learn from your fellow photographers'' solutions to lighting challenges,
        and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.  \n\nThere
        is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As
        photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements
        of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create
        quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter
        time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated
        Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth
        the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.  This Course is the last
        before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project
        over a 2-month period of dedicated photography.  The Peer Review photography
        assignments have been structured with both your advanced capabilities and
        dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both!  Be prepared
        to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments,
        because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!\n\nCourse
        Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print
        form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs
        as well.  The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also
        yours to discover.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept
        and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other
        outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual''s
        creative effort, well that is  important knowledge to have in preparation
        for the Capstone too!

        lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread
        in modernity. \n\nThe Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one

        outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers?
        Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire
        hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet.
        Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make
        better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve
        our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present
        a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on

        science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge
        leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here''s how the course
        will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture.
        Then, I''ll dig deeper. I''ll go into the technical details of the model.
        Those technical lectures won''t require calculus but be prepared for some

        Neuroscience explores the functional organization and neurophysiology of the

        for understanding human behavior. In this course, you will discover the organization
        of the neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation,
        motivate bodily action, and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory, emotion
        and related faculties of cognition. The overall goal of this course is to
        provide the foundation for understanding the impairments of sensation, action
        and cognition that accompany injury, disease or dysfunction in the central
        nervous system. The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior
        studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy,
        as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.\n\nThis online course
        is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical
        neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses
        in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry)
        and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we
        provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School
        of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience
        online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor
        a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units
        of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive
        final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface
        anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization
        of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural
        signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal
        excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post
        synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit
        3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization
        and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative
        to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition,
        and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we
        will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms
        that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next,
        we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous
        system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also
        consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks
        11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the
        cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate
        perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the
        future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and
        regulating brain state.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/medicalneuro/large-icon.png","id":"Nyq7nXzPEeWb-BLhFdaGww","slug":"medical-neuroscience","name":"Medical

        העיקריים של אנרגיה מתחדשת – מקורות אנרגיה טבעיים, זמינים ובלתי מתכלים, שאינם
        גורמים נזק סביבתי, ועשויים להחליף את הדלקים המאובנים. נדבר על אנרגיית השמש,

        subtitles are planned but not yet available.\n\nFuels are the foundations
        of modern living. For over a century we have been drawing fossil fuels – oil,
        coal and natural gas – from the depths of the earth, and using them to power
        our world: advanced industries, fast transportation, comfortable homes and
        more. In this course we will examine possible alternatives for these fuels
        - which have proved quite damaging to both our health and our environment.
        We will describe the intensive worldwide efforts in this field of research,
        and present their encouraging outcome: a range of innovative technologies
        for generating clean energy from natural, non-polluting and renewable sources
        – such as sunlight, wind and water.\n\nThe course will open with some fundamental
        questions on energy: What are the energy needs of the global population today,
        and what will they be tomorrow? What are the resources at our disposal? What
        are the known processes for harvesting, converting and utilizing resources
        of energy? What are the problems generated by the use of fossil fuels? In
        what ways must we change our energy policies and energy economy? And most
        important of all: What are the alternatives to fossil fuels, and can they
        supply humanity''s extensive and constantly growing energy needs?\n\nSubsequent
        lessons will introduce the main types of safe, clean, natural and renewable
        energy sources available to us: solar energy, wind energy, water energy and
        bioenergy. We will speak of existing technologies that already harness these
        resources to the needs of humankind, and supply simple tools for computing
        conversion efficiencies, calculating the amounts of energy produced through
        the various methods, and assessing their economic feasibility.\n\nIn parallel,
        we will discuss the remaining problems and challenges, and ask what must be
        done to enable the large-scale use of renewable energy – in industry, in transportation,
        and in every other sphere of our lives. We will examine several advanced renewable
        energy technologies; explain why they have not yet taken the place of fossil
        fuels; and present cutting-edge innovations and promising research directions
        – in the ongoing global effort to ensure a sustainable future for us all.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/28/9dbde0aedd11e592f52d1e33da9f3c/introduction-to-renewable-energy.jpg","id":"GLXIL6hzEeWu-gqgbeGTiQ","slug":"renewable-energy","name":"מבוא

        to the capstone project course in the Coursera Inspirational Leadership Specialization!
        \nIn the next 6 weeks you''ll apply the skills you learned in the Specialization
        to tackle a real world leadership challenge. \nTo better meet your own goals
        of taking this Specialization, we provide two options for the capstone project:
        \n1) Personal leadership challenge; \n2) Corporate leadership challenges.
        \nYou''ll select one project to implement and will receive assessments from
        your Capstone peers. No matter which option you choose, the capstone project
        will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships
        and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of
        responsibility.\n\nFor the corporate challenge, the CEO will introduce it
        as:\n“In this capstone, you will have to analyze a situation our company is
        experiencing today and prepare recommendations to our executive committee
        explaining how to implement the best possible solution to our leadership challenge.”  \n\nThe
        challenge to be addressed will touch upon the capacity for an organization
        to grow while keeping its sense of purpose. WIth Poilâne, the original sense
        of the company is anchored in the values of making the same quality bread
        for all. When increasing in size and outreach, how can Apollonia and her team
        maintain the same strong values across places and people? With Bla Bla Car,
        the fast pace growth of the company raises the same questions around identity.
        You will find more details as the Capstone unfolds.\nYou can also choose to
        work on your own organization challenge.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you
        will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader.
        A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project,
        designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon…) you have
        for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The
        Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build
        the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhether you choose the corporate challenge
        or corporate challenge, specific questions will attest to your capacity to
        analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by the company or by
        yourself, the capacity for the stakeholders to address the issues. You will
        make recommendations as if you were at the head of the company or the problem.\n\nThe
        process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational
        circuit model developed in MOOC2 “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience”
        and MOOC3 “Leading Organizations” with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn
        the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of
        the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and
        give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The
        second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand
        each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that
        plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration
        will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your
        subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results
        with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase,
        the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the
        company or personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first
        look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time
        and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different
        scenarios for the projected outcomes. Finally, with a view to build sense
        out of the challenge you will come up with recommendations arguing for a preferred
        scenario that respects the values and principles of the organization after
        the change.\nYou will prepare a 10’ presentation for your recommendations
        to be delivered to the CEO of the company or owner of the challenge.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/33c8f044c211e594e0993d66d95520/Vignette-CAPSTONE_student.jpg","id":"sNx-mzaXEeWa2g6sjqf03Q","slug":"leadership-challenge","name":"CAPSTONE:

        \n\nWeek 1: This week''s questions: What factors influence the effectiveness
        of board meetings? What are the formal procedures and structures within the
        board that impact its performance? What can a board do to intentionally improve
        the way it structures itself and runs its decision making meetings? \n\nWeek
        2: This week''s questions:  What do we mean by board composition and development
        and why is it important? Why is it difficult to change the composition of
        the board? How do you design the ideal mix of board members? How do you locate,
        recruit and develop board members?   \n\nWeek 3: This week''s questions: What
        do we mean by the \"culture\" of the board and why is it important? How do
        boards develop and pass along culture? Can board cultures be intentionally
        changed? What is the role of leadership in shaping board culture? What do
        effective nonprofit leaders involved in governance do?  How can leadership
        be managed for higher performance?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked
        to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly
        as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple
        choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess
        knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of
        knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss

        Inquiry is a collaborative and constructive inquiry process that searches
        for everything that gives life to organizations, communities, and larger human
        systems when they are most alive, effective, creative and healthy in their
        interconnected ecology of relationships. To appreciate, quite simply, means
        to value and to recognize that which has value—it is a way of knowing and
        valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship
        it means a research focus—a positive bias—seeking fresh understanding of dynamics
        described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional
        and life-giving. \n\nIn this context the word appreciate means to value those
        things of value—it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic
        appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful
        for—it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path
        of life''s journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in
        value too. Combining the three—appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way
        of being and as an increase in value– suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is
        simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice.  As
        a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically
        for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility
        to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing
        and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating
        are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and
        understood as a seamless and integral whole \n\nLeading Positive Change through
        Appreciative Inquiry is a course dedicated to advancing our understanding
        and skill in leading strength-based change and on how to create, foster and
        manage organizations in which people thrive and perform at their best.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/17/188300c9c911e5bb056da9bfe7c624/shutterstock_92481034.jpg","id":"6OW7QJ3WEeWILQ7D3uPEMw","slug":"appreciative-inquiry","name":"Leading

        in this section is the consequential contradiction between freedom and slavery

        Leading with Sense” as an individual to a group setting. The group could not
        only be an organization such as a company or a team in a company, but also
        a private group such as your family or an association. \n\nSpecifically, you’ll
        apply the 4 steps of The Savoir-Relier protocol to your group: \n1. defining
        the group identity by working on the group self-awareness, \n2. creating quality
        relationships within the group, \n3. working on resilience for the group to
        then be able to overcome difficult situation and \n4. Making the organization
        grow by creating sense and meaning.\n\nSo if you want your group to grow as
        a successful leader in its fields, if you want to find your identity as a
        group and create shared values for it, or if you want your group to become
        more resilient in face of change and crisis, this course is made for you!
        Finally, at the end of the course, you would have build sense for your group
        in order to be more efficient.\n\nUsing real-life cases you will see how the
        genuine, generous and generative characteristics apply to the development
        of successful organizations. For example, you will apply the Relational Circuit
        to recruit effectively, or the Self-Portrait and Conversation exercises to
        create team cohesion and resilience to overcome crises and interpersonal conflicts.
        You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or
        different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense
        will be a driver for you and your surrounding.\n\nLeaders from different organizations,
        will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier
        approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience
        and competitive.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0b/9d2730402e11e5b08037faca9d869b/vign_mooc3_1200.jpg","id":"VyHnEjaTEeWfzhKP8GtZlQ","slug":"leading-organizations","name":"Leading

        using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us
        to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed
        by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts
        lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch
        out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling
        investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing
        poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely
        purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail
        to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer
        offers to match our contributions?\n\nBehavioral finance is the study of these
        and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided,
        if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine
        these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them.
        This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices.
        Learn how to improve your spending, saving, and investing decisions for the
        future.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c6/326590235611e6b8c873bbaf299b3b/piggy-bank-1019758_1920.jpg","id":"NSxhuc9cEeWczg7kSY_tVQ","slug":"duke-behavioral-finance","name":"Behavioral

        vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however
        defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be
        answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of
        various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of
        the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are
        there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures
        that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation
        of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How
        do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective
        lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science,
        politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively
        unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.\n\nThe
        course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into
        3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of

        lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including
        recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities

        computing systems in major ways, and it will change the face of computing
        in the years to come.\n\nWe start the first week by introducing some major
        concepts in cloud computing, the economics foundations of it and we introduce
        the concept of big data. We also cover the concept of software defined architectures,
        and how virtualization results in cloud infrastructure and how cloud service
        providers organize their offerings. In week two, we cover virtualization and
        containers with deeper focus, including lectures on Docker, JVM and Kubernates.
        We finish up week two by comparing the infrastructure as a service offering
        by the big three: Amazon, Google and Microsoft. \nWeek three moves to higher
        level of cloud offering, including platform as a service, mobile backend as
        a service and even serverless architectures. We also talk about some of the
        cloud middleware technologies that are fundamental to cloud based applications
        such as RPC and REST, JSON and load balancing. Week three also covers metal
        as a service (MaaS), where physical machines are provisioned in a cloud environment.
        \nWeek four introduces higher level cloud services with special focus on cloud
        storage services. We introduce Hive, HDFS and Ceph as pure Big Data Storage
        and file systems, and move on to cloud object storage systems, virtual hard
        drives and virtual archival storage options. As discussion on Dropbox cloud

        Cloud Computing Applications course, the second part of a two-course series
        designed to give you a comprehensive view on the world of Cloud Computing
        and Big Data!\n\nIn this second course we continue Cloud Computing Applications
        by exploring how the Cloud opens up data analytics of huge volumes of data
        that are static or streamed at high velocity and represent an enormous variety
        of information. Cloud applications and data analytics represent a disruptive
        change in the ways that society is informed by, and uses information. We start
        the first week by introducing some major systems for data analysis including
        Spark and the major frameworks and distributions of analytics applications
        including Hortonworks, Cloudera, and MapR. By the middle of week one we introduce
        the HDFS distributed and robust file system that is used in many applications
        like Hadoop and finish week one by exploring the powerful MapReduce programming
        model and how distributed operating systems like YARN and Mesos support a
        flexible and scalable environment for Big Data analytics. In week two, our
        course introduces large scale data storage and the difficulties and problems
        of consensus in enormous stores that use quantities of processors, memories
        and disks. We discuss eventual consistency, ACID, and BASE and the consensus
        algorithms used in data centers including Paxos and Zookeeper. Our course
        presents Distributed Key-Value Stores and in memory databases like Redis used
        in data centers for performance. Next we present NOSQL Databases. We visit
        HBase, the scalable, low latency database that supports database operations
        in applications that use Hadoop. Then again we show how Spark SQL can program
        SQL queries on huge data. We finish up week two with a presentation on Distributed
        Publish/Subscribe systems using Kafka, a distributed log messaging system
        that is finding wide use in connecting Big Data and streaming applications
        together to form complex systems. Week three moves to fast data real-time
        streaming and introduces Storm technology that is used widely in industries
        such as Yahoo. We continue with Spark Streaming, Lambda and Kappa architectures,
        and a presentation of the Streaming Ecosystem. Week four focuses on Graph
        Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. We introduce the ideas of
        graph processing and present Pregel, Giraph, and Spark GraphX. Then we move
        to machine learning with examples from Mahout and Spark. Kmeans, Naive Bayes,
        and fpm are given as examples. Spark ML and Mllib continue the theme of programmability
        and application construction. The last topic we cover in week four introduces
        Deep Learning technologies including Theano, Tensor Flow, CNTK, MXnet, and
        Caffe on Spark.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d3/1c09b01d2e11e69fcf2d6c6ce4d4b6/cloud_applications_part-2.jpg","id":"gHycGx0uEeaP7xL2JHHq4w","slug":"cloud-applications-part2","name":"Cloud

        note: The second assignment in this course covers the topic of Graph Analysis
        in the Cloud, in which you will use Elastic MapReduce and the Pig language
        to perform graph analysis over a moderately large dataset, about 600GB. In
        order to complete this assignment, you will need to make use of Amazon Web
        Services (AWS). Amazon has generously offered to provide up to $50 in free
        AWS credit to each learner in this course to allow you to complete the assignment.
        Further details regarding the process of receiving this credit are available
        in the welcome message for the course, as well as in the assignment itself.
        Please note that Amazon, University of Washington, and Coursera cannot reimburse
        you for any charges if you exhaust your credit.\n\nWhile we believe that this
        assignment contributes an excellent learning experience in this course, we
        understand that some learners may be unable or unwilling to use AWS. We are
        unable to issue Course Certificates for learners who do not complete the assignment
        that requires use of AWS. As such, you should not pay for a Course Certificate
        in Communicating Data Results if you are unable or unwilling to use AWS, as
        you will not be able to successfully complete the course without doing so.\n\nMaking
        predictions is not enough!  Effective data scientists know how to explain
        and interpret their results, and communicate findings accurately to stakeholders
        to inform business decisions.  Visualization is the field of research in computer
        science that studies effective communication of quantitative results by linking
        perception, cognition, and algorithms to exploit the enormous bandwidth of
        the human visual cortex.  In this course you will learn to recognize, design,
        and use effective visualizations.\n\nJust because you can make a prediction

        Design is all around us! Words and pictures—the building blocks of graphic
        design—are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the
        digital world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible
        and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important
        in our culture.\n\nThrough visual examples, this course will teach you the
        fundamental principles of graphic design: imagemaking, typography, composition,
        working with color and shape... foundational skills that are common in all
        areas of graphic design practice. I don''t just want you to watch a video
        of someone talking about design, I want you to MAKE design! If you want to
        be a designer you have to be a maker, a communicator, so this course will
        offer you lots of opportunities to get your hands dirty with exercises and
        with more practical projects.\n\nAt the end of this course you will have learned
        how to explore and investigate visual representation through a range of image-making
        techniques; have understand basic principles of working with shape, color
        and pattern; been exposed to the language and skills of typography; and understand
        and have applied the principles of composition and visual contrast. If you
        complete the course, along with its optional (but highly recommended) briefs,
        you will have a core set of graphic design skills that you can apply to your
        own projects, or to more deeply investigate a specialized area of graphic
        design.\n\nTo succeed in this course you will need access to a computer. You
        can complete this course without one but it will be tougher. Access to, and
        a beginner''s level knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite programs, such as Illustrator,

        cours expose la théorie de Galois, du classique critère de non-résolubilité
        des équations polynomiales aux méthodes plus avancées de calcul de groupes
        de Galois par réduction modulo un nombre premier.\n\nLe thème général de cette
        théorie est l''étude des racines d''un polynôme et concerne en particulier
        la possibilité de les exprimer à partir des coefficients de ce polynôme. Evariste
        Galois considère les symétries de ces racines et associe ainsi à ce polynôme
        un groupe de permutations de ses racines, que l''on appelle maintenant son
        groupe de Galois. Il dégage à cette occasion pour la première fois, dans ce
        cadre, la notion de groupe, maintenant omniprésente en mathématiques. Son
        étude lui permet d''expliquer pourquoi les racines d''une équation prise au
        hasard ne s''expriment en général pas par des formules algébriques faisant
        intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un résultat démontré auparavant
        par Abel. Plus généralement, l''étude du groupe de Galois du polynôme permet
        de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe. C''est ce que l''on appelle
        la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d''une part la théorie des corps,
        d''autre part la théorie des groupes.Ce cours expliquera cette théorie en
        n''utilisant que des résultats de base d''algèbre linéaire. Nous étudierons
        d''un côté la théorie des corps, c''est-à-dire la façon dont les corps s''emboîtent
        les uns dans les autres, en introduisant la notion de nombre algébrique (essentiellement
        les racines de polynômes). D''un autre côté, nous introduirons les éléments
        nécessaires à l''étude des groupes de permutations. Cela nous permettra d''expliquer
        la théorie de Galois, non seulement dans son cadre d''origine, c''est-à-dire
        quand les coefficients du polynôme sont des nombres entiers, mais aussi dans
        un cadre plus général, par exemple lorsqu''on réduit ces coefficients modulo
        un nombre premier p.\n\nLe cours culminera avec une comparaison des groupes
        de Galois dans ces deux situations (« entière » et après réduction modulo
        p), fournissant ainsi un outil de calcul puissant de ces groupes.\n\nCe cours
        est l''occasion d''aborder des notions d''algèbre variées, essentielles dans
        de nombreux domaines des mathématiques, de manière très simple pour très rapidement
        aboutir à des résultats tout à fait remarquables. Nous n''avons pas cherché
        la généralité maximale mais au contraire à aller rapidement à l''essentiel
        en utilisant le minimum de formalisme abstrait. Le FLOTeur intéressé sera
        alors armé pour aller plus loin, notamment grâce à la bibliographie ou à des
        cours plus avancés.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3c/e4c3dc881a5619ebbc23901294ab36/mooc_galois.jpg","id":"00citU52EeW2EwoziUhyxQ","slug":"theorie-de-galois","name":"Introduction

        среди жителей Кёнигсберга была распространена такая загадка: как пройти по
        всем мостам через реку Преголя, не проходя ни по одному из них дважды. Многие
        кёнигсбержцы пытались решить эту задачу как теоретически, так и практически
        во время прогулок. Доказать или опровергнуть возможность существования такого
        маршрута никто не мог до 1736 года, когда выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер
        не написал письмо своему другу с решением. Ответ был «нельзя». Так и родилась
        теория графов. Но что будет, если процесс, который описывает граф – случаен?\n\nТеория
        случайных графов находится на стыке теории графов и теории вероятностей. Наука
        появилась в середине ХХ века, и она сразу же привлекла огромное внимание как
        со стороны чистых математиков, так и со стороны прикладников. В курсе мы изучим
        как основы теории случайных графов, так и настоящие ее жемчужины.\n\nМы научимся
        воспринимать многие сложные системы как \"случайные графы\". Среди них – интернет,
        социальные сети (Фейсбука, Вконтакте), биологические, межбанковские сети.\n\nПрослушав
        этот курс, вы проникнетесь чрезвычайно красивой математической теорией и научитесь
        решать комбинаторные и алгоритмические задачи на случайных графах. Все эти
        знания позволят нам затем перейти к курсу веб-графов, в котором мы расскажем
        о самых современных приложениях вероятностно-графовых моделей и конструкций.\n\nДля
        освоения материала будет достаточно математики школьного уровня, базовых знаний
        комбинаторики и теории вероятностей.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/8e6b8057db11e5819e073a88710a2e/randomgr.png","id":"CTZdEFfbEeWsGQ6fKrurvQ","slug":"sluchajnye-graphy","name":"Случайные

        feelings, actions, and results.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be
        able to demonstrate appropriate and effective strategies when engaging in
        coaching conversations with those that you lead. By exploring and analyzing
        common coaching scenarios that are acted out in this course, you will have
        a great sense of what works well and not so well during such a conversation.
        Specifically, you''ll be able to better differentiate between a developmental
        coaching approach and a directive management style, discuss new strategies
        and techniques for dealing with both mind set and skill set gaps, describe
        how to use the feedback loop effectively in a conversation, and demonstrate
        the use of good questioning techniques and the thought model to not only help
        an employee identify issues, but help the employee really change their thinking.\n\nThe
        final assignment is all about actually having a coaching conversation with
        another person where you can apply everything you''ve learned in this course
        and throughout the Coaching Skills for Managers specialization. Again, it
        is highly recommended students complete the other courses in the specialization
        before taking this one. This peer review assignment, in particular, will be
        difficult to complete without knowledge of the topics covered in these courses.\n\nAfter
        going through the course materials and completing the assessments, you will
        be able to have more effective one-on one-coaching meetings with those you
        manage and deepen your understanding of the essential practice of coaching
        conversations.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/52/ae2db09f6811e5af867f53b4df060c/175406985-Course-4-Coaching-conversations.jpg","id":"ISGr03Q9EeWLqw7zlLhRzQ","slug":"coaching-conversations","name":"Coaching

        muchos casos las exportaciones agroalimentarias constituyen una fuente muy
        importante de divisas en las economías latinoamericanas.\n\nEl concepto de

        the book from Yale University Press. \n\nJourney explores cosmic evolution
        as a creative process based on connection, interdependence, and emergence.  It
        examines a range of dynamic interactions in the unfolding of galaxies, Earth,
        life, and human communities. It investigates ways in which we understand evolutionary
        processes and the implications for humans and our ecological future.  \n\nThe
        Journey course, thus, is based on a new integration that is emerging from
        the dialogue of the sciences and humanities. Journey tells the story of evolution
        as an epic narrative, rather than as a series of facts separated by scientific
        disciplines. This changes our perception so that we begin to see ourselves
        as an integral part of this narrative. By situating ourselves within this
        story we can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of processes such
        as self-organizing dynamics, natural selection, emergence, symbiosis, and
        co-evolution. As we discover these intricate processes of evolution, we awaken
        to the beauty and complexity of our natural environment at this critical juncture

        and guide you through some exploratory analysis using tools such as Splunk
        and Open Office. Then we will move into more challenging big data problems
        requiring the more advanced tools you have learned including KNIME, Spark''s

        and development, and introduce you to new models and approaches that harness
        technological, behavioral, and financial innovation. This course will equip
        you with the insights, skills and approaches necessary to successfully overcome
        these obstacles.  In addition, this course will provide participants with
        the tools, models, and approaches to address global grand challenges in conservation
        and development, to question fundamental assumptions, and to create and execute
        new solutions. Course participants will be trained in the processes around
        innovation and design to address global grand challenges.  This includes content
        focused on constructing innovation pipelines, principals of design and engineering
        unique to the developing world and to conservation (Design for the Other 90%),
        on harnessing and developing disruptive technologies, principles of behavior
        and marketing, and on overcoming the challenges with setting up social ventures.\\n\\nThe
        course format will facilitate the development of a global community of innovators

        do so that rethinks traditional assumptions and approaches within both conservation
        and development.  This course will leverage the incredible idealism and interest
        in social entrepreneurship, design, and innovation among the millennials,

        поэтапной моделью работы с художественным текстом, которая может быть использована
        как основа для формирования навыков смыслового чтения художественного произведения.
        Подобные навыки значимы как в реальной коммуникации, так и в учебной деятельности
        (на родном и иностранном языке). Произведение М. Булгакова \\\"Мастер и Маргарита\\\",
        выбранное для формирования навыков смыслового чтения, составляет золотой фонд
        мировой художественной культуры.\\n\\nВ этом курсе слушатели научатся:\\n1.
        анализировать художественное произведение с точки зрения коммуникативного
        замысла автора; \\n2. комментировать текст с точки зрения полученного коммуникативного
        задания; \\n3. интепретировать художественный текст, выделяя содержательные
        и языковые единицы, являющиеся основой развития писательской мысли; \\n4.

        Americans choose their next president, this course explores the history of
        presidential elections via five case studies. It tells the story of key campaigns
        in US history, and by doing so it explores how politics changed over time—and
        how understanding the past sheds light on the current campaign.\\n\\nThe five
        elections that we'll investigate are among the most significant in American
        political history. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson won the presidency in a contest
        that encouraged politicians to reform the electoral college, the system by
        which presidents are still chosen. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860
        prompted the outbreak of the Civil War. It's an election that helps us to
        understand the development of political parties. In 1968, the Vietnam War
        was a dominant concern for Americans, and yet foreign policy played a secondary
        role in Richard Nixon's victory. Twelve years later, in 1980, Ronald Reagan
        won an election that initiated a new era of conservatism. As election day
        approaches, we'll turn our attention to the 2008 election, which many saw
        as signaling a turn to progressivism and as revealing the impact of the digital
        revolution on campaign politics.\\n\\nImage credits:\\n\\nCourse logo - \\\"Former

        its walls razed to ground by Babylon’s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line
        of ancient vanquished cities—from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon
        itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none
        responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and
        enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered
        populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned
        it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The
        biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings
        that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover
        thereby a ground for collective hope.  \\n \\nWorking through colorful biblical
        and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples,
        the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors
        responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community
        at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and
        they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories
        and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt,
        to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the
        Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that
        could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary
        legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important,
        these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new
        wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs
        it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can
        claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part
        in its collective life.\",\"photoUrl\":\"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/b1c0ccbfc15fb49e3719618b36929f/wright-class.jpg\",\"id\":\"39iAT2nMEeSqESIAC44MZQ\",\"slug\":\"bible-history\",\"name\":\"The

        aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines

        used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)

        is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize,

        of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout.    Our goal is for students
        to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental

        capstone project will consist of three options, and you will complete one
        of them as part of the course.\\n\\nThe first option is working with senior-level
        executives to help them solve their most pressing leadership challenges. Two
        (2) senior-level executives from leading organizations will provide detailed
        descriptions of ongoing leadership challenges that they are currently facing
        within their organizations. The challenges will be real and current. You will
        be asked to help the executives think through how best to approach and address
        their respective leadership challenges. Specifically, you will be tasked with
        drafting a memo to one of the executives outlining your recommendations for
        how best to address the leadership challenge. To offer effective advice and
        counsel, you will need to use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose
        the fundamental issue(s), and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions
        or recommendations. The memos will be evaluated based on how effectively you
        apply course concepts to diagnose the problem and how well you link your proposed
        solutions to the diagnosis. The best submissions will be sent to the executives
        for their review, and each executive will offer feedback that will then be
        shared with the entire class to advance everyone’s learning.\\n\\nThe second
        option is to identify your own leadership challenge (e.g., at work, at school,
        in your local community). You should be directly involved in the challenge,
        and the challenge must align with at least one topic from the specialization.
        You will develop a presentation where you use course concepts and frameworks
        to (a) diagnose the core leadership challenge and barriers to effective performance,
        and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations for your
        own leadership challenge.\\n \\nThe third option asks you to interview an
        executive of your choosing. In this interview, you will ask questions about
        the challenges faced by that executive with respect to leading people and
        teams, as well as the practices used by the executive to address his or her
        challenges. In your written submission, you will use course concepts to organize
        the major leadership challenges faced by the executive, highlight the strategies
        and practices used by the executive to address the core leadership challenges,
        and then to evaluate the effectiveness of the executive’s practices related
        to leading people and teams.\",\"photoUrl\":\"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/71/1a0f90502a11e5a352932b5892ee29/lptcapstone.png\",\"id\":\"B07TSjljEeWYbg7p2_3OHQ\",\"slug\":\"leading-teams-project\",\"name\":\"Leading

        perspective gained by Vanderbilt University’s location in Nashville, TN.  Nashville
        is a major center of music in the United States, and the music created here
        has a global reach, particularly in the country, rock, pop, singer-songwriter,
        and Americana genres.  However, students will learn that the basic principles
        of recording, marketing, copyright, licensing, and live performance are the
        same, regardless of musical style or genre.\\n\\nThe music business is one
        of the most rapidly changing industries in the US today.  It is also an industry
        filled with contradiction, and media headlines and anecdotal stories often
        add to the confusion.  Here are just a few statements paraphrased from recent
        news stories: \\n\\n* The music business has collapsed\\n* Demand for music
        is expanding at the greatest rate in history\\n* Historic recording studios
        are closing at an alarming rate\\n* More people are making recordings than
        ever before\\n* Musicians usually lose money touring\\n* Musicians usually
        make money touring\\n* Major artist pulls songs off streaming services because
        they don’t pay fairly\\n* Major artist makes a fortune from streaming services\\n*
        People won’t buy records anymore\\n* Vinyl record sales are soaring\\n\\nThis
        course will attempt to make sense of these seemingly contradictory trends
        and data, outline the basic structure and mechanisms of today’s music industry,
        and encourage students to think critically and entrepreneurially about the
        future of music.  Leaders from various areas of the music business will lend
        their perspectives through in-depth interviews, and footage from a recording
        session will give learners a behind the scenes look at how a song goes from
        the spark of an idea hummed into a cell phone to a finished recording.\\n\\nParticipants
        will grapple with questions about art and commerce which are both timeless

        the essentials needed to begin playing acoustic or electric guitar. You'll
        learn an easy approach to get you playing quickly, through a combination of
        exploring the instrument, performance technique, and basic music theory.\\n\\nFor
        students who have long thought about picking up the acoustic or electric guitar,
        this course will provide an easy-access foundation that will get you playing.
        When first learning guitar, it is important to have the material presented
        in stages, in an enjoyable way that allows you to grasp the basics of the
        instrument and music. The course begins simply with the parts of the guitar,
        the names of the strings, tuning, and technique—whether finger-style or pick.
        It then explores the basics of music theory with such topics as scales, triads,
        power chords, and fingering and shapes.\\n\\nAt the end of this course, students
        will understand the structure, parts, and accessories of the instrument, in
        addition to an understanding of its basic maintenance. Electric guitar players
        will learn the operation of their instrument along with basic options for
        amplification, effect pedals, and sounds. Students will also learn to develop
        correct technique and apply theory concepts to their playing. They will have
        the foundational knowledge necessary to pursue most intermediate guitar courses.\",\"photoUrl\":\"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/7fb650f76111e5ac3c516fd03a9de3/woman-playing-guitar_25103178309_o.jpg\",\"name\":\"Introduction

        questions about different formats (data, images, music and video) can be especially
        difficult.  Sometimes the law specifically distinguishes between these different

        a copyright analysis.  In this course we will look at four different media,
        paying special attention to the unique issues for each one and the kinds of
        information that is important when making copyright decisions for each type
        of material.  We will work through fair use issues for each multimedia format,

        main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision
        making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.\\n\\nIn the first
        week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences,
        discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making.
        We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably,
        Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no \\\"perfect\\\" voting system,
        and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We
        move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents
        are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We
        explain \\\"mechanism design\\\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions
        between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our
        third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate
        happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves
        mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem
        of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides
        an introduction to auction theory.\\n\\nYou can find a full syllabus and description

        the first half of the course, we will compare two short biological sequences,
        such as genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or proteins.  We will encounter
        a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine
        the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.\\n\\nIn
        the second half of the course, we will \\\"zoom out\\\" to compare entire

        seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of
        years of evolution.  Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves:
        just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there
        locations in our genome that are \\\"fragile\\\" and more susceptible to be
        broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms

        в конце 19 века исследователи обратили внимание на значимость роли медиа в
        социальных, политических, экономических, культурных процессах, а в 20 веке
        масс-медиа стали целой индустрией, производящей и воспроизводящей прообразы
        и репрезентации этих процессов, идеологии и картины мира. 21 век же ставит
        новые вопросы о том, что такое медиа и как они участвуют в формировании личности,
        конструировании социального пространства, политических режимов и в развитии
        экономики. \n\nОсновная цель курса – сформировать базовые представления о
        развитии медиа и нарисовать карту обширного поля медиатеорий. В связи с этим
        он состоит из двух частей – первая посвящена истории развития медиасистем,
        а вторая рассматривает ключевые теории медиа.  \n\nПервая часть курса знакомит
        с основными технологическими вехами в развитии медиа и в то же время позволяет
        увидеть историю медиа как историю развития социального института. Основное
        внимание уделяется развитию институтов медиа преимущественно с момента появления
        национальных государств в Западной Европе до настоящего момента.  Курс рассматривает
        роль, которую играют медиа в формировании национальных идентичностей, капиталистической
        экономики, представлений о гражданских свободах и т.д. Отдельный модуль посвящен
        истории цензуры, поскольку история медиа тесно связана с этим явлением. \n\nВторая
        часть курса посвящена рассмотрению ключевых теоретических подходов к изучению
        медиа и коммуникаций, возникавших начиная с 1940-х годов и до сегодняшнего
        дня. Так, слушатели познакомятся с эмпирико-функционалистской и лингвистической
        группами медиа теорий, с идеями критической теории, парадигмой медиадетерминизма,
        теориями сетевого общества, с коммуникационным аспектом социологии технических
        инноваций, с микросоциальными теориями коммуникации, с изучением медиа в рамках
        направления cultural studies и политэкономии.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/37/23f7f01c5911e6b8723341957cd3a2/media1.jpg","id":"ix4wfRhfEea3DxJjpF7HPw","slug":"teoriya-smi","name":"История

        analytics is a data-driven approach to managing people at work. For the first
        time in history, business leaders can make decisions about their people based
        on deep analysis of data rather than the traditional methods of personal relationships,
        decision making based on experience, and risk avoidance. In this brand new
        course, three of Wharton’s top professors, all pioneers in the field of people
        analytics, will explore the state-of-the-art techniques used to recruit and
        retain great people, and demonstrate how these techniques are used at cutting-edge
        companies. They’ll explain how data and sophisticated analysis is brought
        to bear on people-related issues, such as recruiting, performance evaluation,
        leadership, hiring and promotion, job design, compensation, and collaboration.
        This course is an introduction to the theory of people analytics, and is not
        intended to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis.
        By the end of this course, you’ll understand how and when hard data is used
        to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development, so that
        you can position yourself as a strategic partner in your company’s talent

        lecturers do their teaching in English, in line with university internationalisation

        opportunities for them to link up with colleagues from universities all over
        the world who share the same discipline and discourse community, to ask questions
        and exchange ideas.\nThis MOOC targets lecturers who wish to begin using English
        in their teaching. A priori, this means university lecturers from countries
        where English is not the L1 or a widely-used language (Romance language-speaking
        countries, for example), though in fact the course is open to teachers from
        all educational stages who want to teach through English, following the principles
        of EMI (English Medium Instruction).\n\nOn completing the course, you should
        be able to do the following.\n\na) Teach a university subject in English,
        having gained the necessary confidence and skills.\n \nb) Integrate all aspects
        of CLIL (methodological, pedagogical, strategic, attitudinal, motivational,
        linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic) to put together their own English-medium
        course on their particular subject.\n\nc) Describe the characteristics of
        the university lecture discourse genre (planning, agents, channels, phases,
        dynamics, and current flexibility of the genre).\n\nd) Understand and perform
        the basic linguistic macro-functions within English teaching discourse.\n\ne)
        Understand and perform, using the appropriate linguistic exponents (vocabulary,
        structures, and phraseology), the main micro-functions in English teaching
        discourse: metalinguistic, informative, evaluative, inductive, and social.\n\nf)
        Consolidate their oral expression and interaction skills, and their grammar

        and longer we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the
        transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric,
        in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively
        untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes
        sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print
        textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and
        learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper
        test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems?
        Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change.
        Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\n\nBut what
        might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis
        course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine
        possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century
        learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal
        Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7.
        Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed,
        will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated
        by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace,
        public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples
        of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees,
        demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended
        Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for
        people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\"
        including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing
        teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is
        currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who
        regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nTake
        this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis
        course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution
        by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate,
        masters, and doctoral level students in the College of Education at the University
        of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want
        to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions. Some people
        say that these limited kinds of participation offer evidence that MOOCs suffer
        from low retention rates. Far from it – we say that any level of engagement

        the intersection of politics and economics. It shows that rather than develop
        into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels
        of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development.
        Such a “political” economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which
        we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds
        and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public
        policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system.
        China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in
        politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence
        their leaders’ decisions. Finally, we assess China’s future and whether rapid
        economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push
        China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely
        to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese

        viewers through their compositions is an essential craft for photographers
        no matter whether their subject matter is pure documentary or vividly exotic
        personal expression.  In Modules 3 & 4 we survey the essential elements of
        post-photography image management, using Adobe(tm) LIGHTROOM(tm).  Image adjustment
        software designed for Smartphone photographers rounds out the Course.  Since
        even photographers whose mainstay is a high-end DSLR also must admit to Smartphone
        use occasionally, and photographers who only use a Smartphone will usually
        admit that they want to step over to a \"regular\" camera at some point, there
        is something for everyone here!  Let''s get started with Module One!","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4f/e25b60b4d011e5b7f4377491ebab0b/Coursera-Specialization-Thumbnail-IMG_2026-copy.jpg","id":"KRl9hpiaEeWF6gpQJiw6hQ","slug":"photo-composition","name":"Principles

        beautiful classical theory on field extensions of a certain type (Galois extensions)
        initiated by Galois in the 19th century. Explains, in particular, why it is
        not possible to solve an equation of degree 5 or more in the same way as we
        solve quadratic or cubic equations. You will learn to compute Galois groups
        and (before that) study the properties of various field extensions.\n\nWe
        first shall survey the basic notions and properties of field extensions: algebraic,
        transcendental, finite field extensions, degree of an extension,  algebraic
        closure, decomposition field of a polynomial. \nThen we shall do a bit of
        commutative algebra (finite algebras over a field, base change via tensor
        product) and apply this  to study the notion of separability in some detail.
        \nAfter that we shall discuss Galois extensions and Galois correspondence
        and give many examples (cyclotomic extensions, finite fields, Kummer extensions,
        Artin-Schreier extensions, etc.). \nWe shall address the question of solvability
        of equations by radicals (Abel theorem). We shall also try to explain the
        relation to representations and to topological  coverings. \nFinally, we shall
        briefly discuss  extensions of rings (integral elemets, norms, traces, etc.)
        and explain how to use the reduction modulo primes to compute Galois groups.\n\nPREREQUISITES
        \nA first course in general algebra — groups, rings, fields, modules, ideals.
        Some knowledge of commutative algebra (prime and maximal ideals — first few
        pages of any book in commutative algebra) is welcome. For exercises we also
        shall need some elementary facts about groups and their actions on sets, groups
        of permutations and, marginally, \nthe statement of Sylow''s theorems.\n\nASSESSMENTS\nA
        weekly test and two more serious exams in the middle and in the end of the

        good reason there is mounting concern that organizational groups and teams
        often fail to learn from their experience.  This is deeply troubling because
        groups and teams are often the main ways that work gets done in organizations.  Organizational
        groups and teams are often the engines of project planning, project work,
        strategy development and implementation and innovation to name some of their
        purposes.  Two of the main reasons that groups and teams are often ineffective
        is because of: 1) the lack of organizational structures and support for teams
        and groups, and 2) the lack of understanding and emphasis on learning.  This
        lack of team effectiveness seems to be widespread and some have argued that
        teams regularly fail to meet their goals.  Sadly too many organizations are
        inhospitable to learning and end up undermining or squashing the learning
        that occurs in teams and groups that they need to survive.  Through misaligned
        reward structures, covert norms, and organizational culture too many organizations
        suppress learning.  Given what appears to fast becoming a crisis in team,

        environmental challenge.  The environmental industry is continuously looking
        for remediation methods that are both effective and cost-efficient. Over the
        past 10 years there have been amazing, important developments in our understanding
        of key attenuation processes and technologies for evaluating natural attenuation
        processes, and a changing institutional perspective on when and where Monitored

        important? \n\nMilk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such
        as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several
        B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals
        such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other
        minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child
        with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?\n\nMost
        milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes,
        goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India,
        the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers
        in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods
        to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production
        is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million
        small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged
        in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries,
        but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United
        States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk
        production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over
        205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by
        a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over
        10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What
        methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we
        balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection?
        This course will provide the student with information to better understand
        dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.\n\nIn

        important population group.\n\nWith over 25% of the world’s population aged
        between 10 and 24 years, today’s generation of young people is the largest
        in human history. As the future leaders and drivers of growth, productivity
        and innovation, young people are our greatest assets, and investment in their
        health and wellbeing has social, economic and other benefits that continue
        across the lifespan and into the next generation.\n\nIn this course we will
        adopt a life-course framework to take a holistic view of youth health and
        wellbeing. We will explore changing patterns of adolescent health and development,
        including why adolescence is starting earlier and ending later; how puberty
        and adolescent brain development may shape future health; and how what happens
        in adolescence can affect the start to life for the next generation. We’ll

        is a course on social norms, the rules that glue societies together. It teaches
        how to diagnose social norms, and how to distinguish them from other social
        constructs, like customs or conventions. These distinctions are crucial for
        effective policy interventions aimed to create new, beneficial norms or eliminate
        harmful ones. The course teaches how to measure social norms and the expectations
        that support them, and how to decide whether they cause specific behaviors.
        We also look at a variety of tools policy makers may use to effect change,
        highlight the role of trendsetters in social change, and the conditions under
        which they can be successful. The course is a joint Penn-UNICEF project, and
        it includes many examples of norms that sustain behaviors like child marriage,
        gender violence and sanitation practices.\n\nThis is Part 1 of the Social
        Norms, Social Change series.  In these lectures, I introduce all the basic
        concepts and definitions, such as social expectations and conditional preferences,
        that help us distinguish between different types of social practices like
        customs, descriptive norms and social norms. Expectations and preferences
        can be measured, and these lectures explain how to measure them. Measurement
        is crucial to understand the nature of the practice you are facing, but also
        whether an intervention was or was not successful, and why.  In Part 2, we
        will examine social change, the tools we may use to enact change, and put
        into practice all we have learned in Part 1.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/4235a0dcb511e5831c974ec7bbd7a3/Wordle.png","id":"0jwqe3EyEeWxvQr3acyajw","slug":"norms","name":"Social

        demand上线，在on demand上，我们将所有课程内容全部上载，没有教学时限，由学生自行安排学习时间和进度，自己完成课后练习，以便随时为需要的学生提供学习的资料和练习。练习题可以多次尝试，只是必须做对每个模块练习题的80%，才可以通过。又考虑到《电磁学》内容比较多，因此将原来十三周的教学内容分成两个学习阶段。《电磁学上》包含的内容是《大学物理通用教程》电磁学的前三章即静电场、导体和电介质以及直流电。这三部分内容属于恒定电场范畴，这些内容应该是深入学习电磁学的基础，在这部分课程结尾，设置了一个结业考试，相当于大学课程的期中考试。第二个学习进程《电磁学下》包含的内容是《大学物理通用教程》电磁学的后五章即恒磁场、磁介质，电磁感应、交流电和电磁场电磁波。建议大家学习了第一进程，通过了结业考试以后再进入第二学习进程《电磁学下》的学习。\n        本课程的课程是按照知识点设置模块，《电磁学上》包含5个模块，《电磁学下》包含6个模块。每个模块又包含几节课，每个模块结束有一个小测，同学们可以自我测试，没有时间限制，大家可以根据自己的需要和时间安排来自主学习，以免一步跟不上，步步跟不上，这对于学习我们这种理论性比较强的课是有利的，已经明白的可以跳过去，不清楚的可以重点学习。\n       《电磁学上》包含以下五个模块\n模块一      库仑定律和电场强度
        \n模块二      高斯定理和环路定理\n模块三      导体与静电平衡\n模块四      电介质与电场能量\n模块五      直流电\n欢迎大家选课！","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/8a988013b611e4912df96cfa655a37/___-2-__.jpg","name":"电磁学上——恒定电场","id":"YXLa-lM0EeWEHRLwpfV5DQ","slug":"dianci"},{"courseType":"v1.session","description":"Students

        cursos de Cálculo Diferencial y Cálculo Integral tradicionalmente se ofrecen
        separados y respetando ese orden. El primero estudia la derivada, y el segundo,
        la integral, siendo este momento en el que aparece el Teorema Fundamental
        del Cálculo (TFC) para establecer la relación entre ambos conceptos. En el
        presente curso vamos a hacer una diferencia: introduciremos la derivada y
        la integral como conceptos relacionados desde un principio. \n\nVamos a iniciar
        con la interpretación del Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo, con esto nos referimos
        a descubrir su significado real en la solución de problemas. Llegaremos a
        asociar con él la actividad práctica de calcular el valor de una magnitud
        que está cambiando. Habiendo realizado esta interpretación, los conceptos
        de derivada e integral se verán relacionados desde un principio, lo que te
        permitirá predecir el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Las nociones
        fundamentales de derivada e integral las identificaremos con las ideas de
        “razón de cambio” y de “acumulación del cambio”, y el TFC nos proveerá de
        la estrategia de solución.\n \nRecordarás que la Matemática Elemental incluye
        el Álgebra, la Geometría y la Geometría Analítica. Podemos decir que éstas
        son Matemáticas que estudian lo estático. En cambio, la Matemática Superior,
        que incluye el Cálculo, estudia lo dinámico. Con el Cálculo se inicia el estudio
        del cambio, una realidad presente en nuestro entorno cotidiano sin duda alguna.
        Costos, temperaturas, poblaciones, velocidades, energías, capitales de inversión,
        longitudes, etc., son algunos ejemplos de esto. En este curso podrás entender
        al Cálculo como una estrategia de solución para el estudio del cambio y diferenciarlo
        de las Matemáticas Elementales, aunque utilice de ellas bastante información.\n
        \nAl finalizar este curso podrás:\n\nDescribir de qué manera los modelos matemáticos
        polinomial, exponencial natural, y trigonométricos (seno y coseno), son una
        construcción que responde a esta práctica de predicción. Los verás a todos
        ellos surgir de esta práctica cuando una magnitud real particular cumple ciertas
        condiciones en su “razón de cambio” con respecto a la magnitud de la que depende.
        \n\nUtilizar la introducción de procesos infinitos (¡no imposibles!) en la
        construcción de la respuesta de predicción, con ello entenderás por qué se
        habla de Matemática Superior y de un pensamiento matemático avanzado.\n\nValorar
        una forma de pensar diferente, donde nuestro razonamiento matemático trascienda
        la sola manipulación de fórmulas algebraicas.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/52/8181b0baee11e59326e18df13c8d1f/CALCULODIFERENCIAL.png","id":"_mOFSBtlEeWP9g4JMjGIiQ","slug":"calculo-diferencial","name":"Cálculo

        mondialisation et l''européanisation favorisent le développement rapide des
        villes à travers le monde. L''urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui
        avec l''essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d''habitants) comme Calcutta,
        Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul.
        Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens
        à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles
        », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours
        passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels
        proposés par les sciences sociales afin d''en analyser et comparer les développements
        contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions
        urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance
        d''un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l''apparente convergence
        de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec
        le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d''identifier des différenciations
        masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner
        à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes
        mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d''enracinement
        mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité,
        les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences
        sociales développés en Occident pour l''analyse de la transformation de Lagos
        ? Jusqu''à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de
        comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences
        sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons
        entre nations ? \nPour l''instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme,
        les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent
        de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale,
        caractérisée par la taille, par l''agrégation des logements, les divisions
        différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions
        de la ville ont fini par s''entremêler et parfois s''opposer. Ces conceptions
        soulignent différents processus d''intégration : la ville matérielle et ses
        murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses
        déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires,
        des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des
        textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les
        politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement,
        de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d''éducation
        ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et
        de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie
        de la ville : la division du travail, l''échelle, la production, la consommation,
        le commerce.....\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités,
        le logement, le gouvernement, l''intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur
        le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l''enracinement, sur le développement
        durable et les risques, sur l''apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle
        social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l''innovation, et le développement

        !\n\nWelcome to this on-demand MOOC “In the footsteps of Zika… approaching
        the unknown”. \n\nThis MOOC has been produced by Université de Genève (www.unige.ch),
        Institut Pasteur (www.pasteur.fr), Université Paris Descartes (www.parisdescartes.fr)
        and Centre Virchow-Villermé (virchowvillerme.eu).\n\nWith the help of the
        intervention of faculty members and international experts, we will explore
        together the recent Zika phenomenon, a previously rare benign virus that recently
        turned unexpectedly into the limelight when on the 1st of February 2016 it
        was declared by the WHO as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
        \nAs this outbreak is still ongoing and under close investigation, this MOOC
        has the opportunity to be an open learning experience that will follow the
        marked developments and new discoveries over time. This MOOC will bring you
        to the heart of the Zika outbreak and invite you to this adventure in uncharted
        territories. \nMoreover, we invite you to join the interactive dialogue among
        participants and facilitators through a community of practice, which promotes
        questions, critical thinking, participatory learning, as well as interrelated
        and ongoing collaborative information. \nLet us learn hand in hand all together
        to go further in finding clues and eventually solutions!\n\nCourse description
        \n\nThis interdisciplinary course is divided into 8 modules available in 4
        languages (subtitles in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish). \nEach module
        is organized around a central topic that will help those who take the course
        to develop their skills and knowledge. Each module provides\n- interviews
        with specialists\n- quizes\n- recommended readings\n- online videos and web
        links. \n\nThis MOOC will cover a range of topics, such as epidemiology, historical
        and geographical dispersion of the virus and its vectors through globalization
        and climate change, its modes of transmission, but also the symptoms, diagnosis
        and treatment. The different types of preventive measures will be also covered.
        \nA special module will focus on possible neurological adverse effects such
        as the risk for birth defects (microcephaly) in pregnant women, while another
        one will examine the peripheral nerve paralysis called the Guillain-Barré
        syndrome. \nThe fact that Zika presents a significant threat to political
        and economic stabilities and thus reinforces social inequity through South
        America will be addressed. \nThe revolution in cultural, religious, and legal
        norms in front of the expansion of Zika will be also debated. \nFinally, the
        last two modules will state the role, recommendations and response measures
        of policy makers and public health organizations under the light of medias.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/60/a82b70439911e6a9296b229cc47947/logo.png","id":"xASZdzkZEea1eg6YQeunOw","slug":"zika","name":"In

        так давно получил распространение термин «большие данные», обозначивший новую
        прикладную область — поиск способов автоматического быстрого анализа огромных
        объёмов разнородной информации. Наука о больших данных ещё только оформляется,
        но уже сейчас она очень востребована — и в будущем будет востребована только
        больше.\nС её помощью можно решать невероятные задачи: оценивать состояние
        печени по кардиограмме, предсказывать зарплату по описанию вакансии, предлагать
        пользователю музыку на основании его анкеты в интернете.\n\nБольшими данными
        может оказаться что угодно: результаты научных экспериментов, логи банковских
        транзакций, метеорологические наблюдения, профили в социальных сетях — словом,
        всё, что может быть полезно проанализировать.\nСамым перспективным подходом
        к анализу больших данных считается применение машинного обучения — набора
        методов, благодаря которым компьютер может находить в массивах изначально
        неизвестные взаимосвязи и закономерности.\n\nНа факультете компьютерных наук
        ВШЭ и в Школе анализа данных есть люди, активно использующие машинное обучение
        и разрабатывающие новые подходы к нему. Именно они — преподаватели этого курса.\n\nВы
        изучите основные типы задач, решаемых с помощью машинного обучения — в основном
        речь пойдёт о классификации, регрессии и кластеризации. Узнаете об основных
        методах машинного обучения и их особенностях, научитесь оценивать качество
        моделей — и решать, подходит ли модель для решения конкретной задачи. Наконец,
        познакомитесь с современными библиотеками, в которых реализованы обсуждаемые
        модели и методы оценки их качества. Для работы мы будем использовать реальные
        данные из реальных задач.\n\nКраткая программа курса:\nНеделя 1. Введение.
        Примеры задач. Логические методы: решающие деревья и решающие леса.\nНеделя
        2. Метрические методы классификации. Линейные методы, стохастический градиент.\nНеделя
        3. Метод опорных векторов (SVM). Логистическая регрессия. Метрики качества
        классификации.\nНеделя 4. Линейная регрессия. Понижение размерности, метод
        главных компонент.\nНеделя 5. Композиции алгоритмов, градиентный бустинг.
        Нейронные сети.\nНеделя 6. Кластеризация и визуализация. Частичное обучение.\nНеделя
        7. Прикладные задачи анализа данных: постановки и методы решения.\n\nСлушателю
        нужно знать об основных понятиях математики: функциях, производных, векторах,
        матрицах. Для выполнения практических заданий потребуются базовые навыки программирования.
        Очень желательно знать Python. Задания рассчитаны на использование этого языка
        и его библиотек numpy, pandas и scikit-learn.\n\nЧтобы успешно завершить курс,
        нужно набрать проходную сумму баллов за тесты и практические задания, а также
        выполнить финальный проект, посвящённый решению прикладной задачи анализа
        данных.\n\nМы уверены, что этот курс будет полезен каждому, кто хочет постичь
        искусство предсказательного моделирования и освоить интеллектуальный анализ
        данных.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a2/c23430579811e59644373576122c07/Ya-Icon-new-size.jpg","id":"01XLylXyEeWKXg4Y7_tPaw","slug":"vvedenie-mashinnoe-obuchenie","name":"Введение

        about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and
        the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.\n\nWith
        the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the
        tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made
        in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone
        can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software
        package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing
        music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is
        where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there
        is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course
        will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following
        along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe
        will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive
        it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer,
        so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music
        production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a
        timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression
        of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary
        music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a
        piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project.
        We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music
        production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined
        or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if
        you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware
        and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts,
        sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than
        the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified
        from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression,
        equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots
        of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the
        end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is
        a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools
        are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea
        in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to
        reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course
        will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/47/177f107cc211e58b0e75bcc028bad2/IMP.png","id":"e9PicBJhEeaoZBKRisF_Dw","slug":"technology-of-music-production","name":"The

        European Union is one of the world’s largest and most important economies.
        This five week course is the first in a series of three that will provide
        students with an insight into European Business Law. The series ranges from
        considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing
        on various specialized areas of law. Each course will give the students an
        understanding of the laws and policies that regulate the internal market of
        European Union, as well as relevant case law and useful inputs from leading
        practitioners in the field. \n\nAt the end of this course series, you will
        have a basic understanding of how to:\n\n•\tNavigate EU legal sources\n\n•\tUnderstand
        relevant laws and regulations governing the internal European Union market\n\n•\tApply
        the fundamental principles of EU law within the EU legal framework\n\n•\tUtilize
        the rules of freedom of movement and their impacts on trade in the EU\n\n•\tRelate
        EU law with national laws\n\n•\tUnderstand EU policies and their influence
        on foreign trade and investment\n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nIn the first course,
        Understanding the Fundamentals, we will examine the core structures and principles
        of the European Union as well as the main sources of law. In the second course,
        Doing business in Europe, we will focus on the main laws that regulate various
        aspects of establishing and running a business within the European Union.
        In the final course, Competing in Europe, we will go into more depth about
        how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention.

        and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module
        represents about one week of work. A module includes a number of lectures
        and readings, and finishes with a voluntary assessment – a quiz, a small peer
        graded assignment or a case law review. The assessments are intended to encourage
        learning and ensure that you understand the material of the course. Participating
        in forum discussions is voluntary. \n\nCourse I - Understanding the Fundamentals\n\nModule

        of Law is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international
        and Swedish students. The university offers two international Masters: European
        Business Law and Human Rights Law. The former provides an in-depth understanding
        of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the
        European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge
        of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending
        to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. \n\nEducation, research
        and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s
        work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes
        and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course
        in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves
        in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and
        professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various
        areas of law.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4c/c09450ebc911e3b776713ecb7a4d38/European_draft3.png","id":"gSfwG3HcEeWLqw7zlLhRzQ","slug":"european-law-fundamentals","name":"European

        you ever experienced software systems failing? Websites crash, calendar not
        synchronising, or even a power blackout. Of course you have! But did you know
        that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within
        a system or between systems? Depending on the system, the impact of software
        failures can be huge, even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of
        lives. Software, and in particular the communication between software-intensive
        systems, is very complex and very difficult to get right. However, we _need_
        dependability in the systems we use, directly or indirectly, to support us
        in our everyday lives.\n\nSystem Validation helps you to design embedded system
        behaviour that is structurally sound. It also enforces you to make the behaviour
        simple and insightful; systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also
        much easier to maintain and adapt. System Validation is the field that studies
        the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. The techniques
        put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors. \n\nThis
        first course ’Automata and behavioural equivalences'', builds the foundation
        of the subsequent courses, showing you how to look at system behaviour as
        state machines. It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these
        in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition
        systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled
        systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such
        automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward,
        but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex
        behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural
        properties of such systems precisely. Especially, in the combination with
        hiding of behaviour, equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain
        insight in the behaviour of systems, far more effective than simulation or
        testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct. Such models form
        an excellent basis for the production of concise, reliable and maintainable
        software.\n\nThis course is part I of the set of courses for System Validation.
        System Validation, as a set of courses, is part of a larger EIT Digital online

        a whole\".\n\nThe objective of this MOOC is to develop an understanding of
        the problems related to water management. Firstly, this course will define
        a resource and, more specifically, the resource of water. It will look at
        how water is used and the activities associated with it as well as any potential
        conflicts. The course will look at water management in detail through the
        analysis of the different types of rights and obligations associated with,
        for example, the development of a multi-sectorial regulation system or a watershed
        management approach.\n\nBy the end of this course, our aim is to enable you
        to:\n1) Identify the main issues and strategies linked to water resource management\n2)
        Acquire the key reading material needed to understand the many variables (environmental,
        institutional and political) which affect water and which, in terms of management,
        may require adjustment.\n\nThis course was developed by the Geneva Water Hub
        and is financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).

        des villes qui les accueillent.\n\nLa croissance rapide des villes s’est accompagnée,
        sur l’ensemble des continents, de mécanismes parfois déroutants de production
        urbaine qui ont mis à mal les équilibres territoriaux et sociaux des agglomérations.
        \n\nA  l’heure actuelle, près d’un milliard de personnes dans le monde, vivent
        dans des quartiers précaires, en raison des mauvaises conditions d’accueil

        où la croissance s’opère principalement en périphérie, par la création de
        quartiers précaires où se concentre la pauvreté urbaine.\n\nL’existence et
        l’extension de ce type de quartiers interrogent sur la capacité de ces villes

        cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils
        peuvent jouer dans la mise en place de services d’infrastructures, en particulier
        dans les économies émergentes. Les participants bénéficieront de l’expertise
        de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une
        véritable expérience de terrain, sur les opportunités et les défis que présentent
        la mise en place et la maintenance d’infrastructures affectées aux services
        publics par des PPP efficaces.\n\nLe cours comprend des films vidéo, des lectures,
        des questionnaires et autres matériels d’apprentissage conçus et enseignés
        par des experts notamment de l’Université d’Harvard, l’Université John Hopkins,
        L’université de la Sorbonne, l’Université Panthéon-Assas, la Facilité Africaine
        de Soutien Juridique, la Banque d’Investissement Européenne, le Fond Monétaire
        International, l’Agence Française de Développement, et la Banque mondiale.\n\nCe
        cours vous apportera ce dont vous avez besoin pour mieux comprendre les PPP,
        que vous soyez un membre de la société civile, du grand public, un praticien,
        un fonctionnaire d’état ou un décideur politique.\n\n~~ A propos du cours\n\nPartout
        dans le monde et en particulier dans les pays en développement, les gouvernements
        rencontrent des difficultés pour mettre en place et maintenir les infrastructures
        nécessaires à la croissance économique de leur pays et à la prestation de
        services publics de base aux citoyens. Les partenariats public-privés (PPP)
        sont un des outils que les gouvernements peuvent utiliser pour contribuer
        à la mise en place de meilleurs services publics. Ce cours vous permettra
        de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans
        la réduction du déficit d’infrastructures. Le cours présentera les difficultés
        et les défis rencontrés lors de la sélection des projets jusqu’à leur mise
        en œuvre. Ainsi, vous améliorerez votre compréhension sur l’opportunité ou
        non de recourir à un PPP pour développer un projet d’infrastructure.\n\nDurant
        ce cours de quatre semaines, vous bénéficierez de l’expertise de praticiens,
        de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience
        transactionnelle pour approfondir vos connaissances.\nPlusieurs ressources
        seront proposées chaque semaine, tels des films vidéos d’experts et de praticiens,
        des lectures obligatoires et facultatives, un questionnaire à choix multiples
        portant sur le thème de la semaine, et des exercices pour parfaire vos compétences
        d’analyse, de réflexion et de communication.\n\n~~ Semaine 1: Réduire le déficit
        d’infrastructure : le rôle des PPP\n\nCe premier module explique comment et
        pourquoi l’expertise et les ressources du secteur privé peuvent être mobilisées
        par les gouvernements pour contribuer à la réduction de leur déficit d’infrastructures.
        Ce module introduit le concept de PPP, ses caractéristiques, et les types
        de modalités contractuelles reflétant le degré de participation du secteur
        privé. Les PPP ne regroupent pas tous les contrats entre une personne publique
        et une personne privée, et ce module définit également ce que n’est pas un
        PPP. Des exemples d’échecs ou de PPP réussis seront utilisés pour illustrer
        les conditions optimales pour réussir des projets, et pour souligner la nécessité
        d’une analyse précise, ainsi que l’importance de la durabilité, la participation
        des acteurs et la bonne gouvernance des PPP.\n\n~~ Semaine 2: Prendre les
        bonnes décisions: les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPP\n\nCe
        module examine les principes, valeurs et défis que requièrent la mise en place
        d’un cadre facilitant l’exécution des projets de PPP dans l’optique d’améliorer
        les services publics et l’investissement en infrastructure. Vous bénéficierez
        des leçons apprises lors de la réalisation des PPP et de leur incorporation
        dans des cadres législatifs efficaces. La semaine 2 vous apportera également
        une vue d’ensemble des différentes étapes du cycle de vie des PPP et approfondira
        la première phase : l’identification et la sélection des projets.\n\n~~ Semaine
        3: Susciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié: la passation des PPP\n\nCe
        module débute par une discussion sur la nécessité de développer des arguments
        commerciaux solides pour transformer un projet en PPP, et insiste sur l’importance
        de la structure du partenariat pour garantir une répartition des risques appropriée
        entre les commanditaires privés, les bailleurs de fonds, et le gouvernement.
        Ce module passe en revue les différentes étapes du processus d’appel d’offres
        et explique les défis rencontrés pour parvenir à un bon résultat, et explique
        le rôle des bailleurs qui sont souvent des acteurs clés dans la structuration
        de l’appel d’offre.\n\n~~ Semaine 4: Obtenir un partenariat réussi: la mise
        en œuvre du PPP \n\nCe module présente les aspects fondamentaux et les difficultés
        dans la gestion des contrats, tels que l’application de l’exécution du contrat,
        et sa renégociation ou sa résiliation. Enfin, ce module couvre la gestion
        des offres non sollicitées qui, bien qu’en dehors d’un processus de mise en
        concurrence, peuvent être une source d’idées innovantes.\n\n~~ Comment bénéficier
        au maximum de ce cours? Interagir et approfondir\n\nLes participants peuvent
        choisir l’un des deux parcours « Compréhension des PPP » ou « Politique et
        Pratique des PPP » en fonction de leur intérêt et objectifs professionnels.
        Le parcours « Compréhension des PPP » vise les personnes ayant un intérêt
        général pour les PPP et désirant améliorer leur compréhension du sujet. Le
        parcours permet aux auditeurs de se familiariser avec les concepts de base
        des PPP et leurs principaux outils, et offre la possibilité de communiquer
        avec des professionnels et des praticiens. Le parcours « Politique et Pratique
        des PPP » est destiné aux auditeurs souhaitant obtenir une meilleure connaissance
        des PPP et approfondir leur apprentissage.\n\nQuel que soit le parcours choisi,
        des questions seront soulevées et des points clés seront discutés sur le forum
        Coursera tout au long de la semaine. Nous espérons qu’en plus du forum de
        discussion, vous vous connecterez sur des réseaux sociaux (tels Twitter et
        Google+) pour profiter pleinement de votre participation au cours. Les membres
        de l’équipe de cette formation en ligne seront là pour vous aider à développer

        géographiques\n- Il s’agit d’un cours pratique qui repose sur l’utilisation
        de logiciels libres, notamment QGIS\nEn somme, si vos études ou votre profession
        comprennent des activités liées à la gestion de territoires, à l’analyse d’objets
        distribués dans l’espace géographique (aménagement du territoire, biologie,
        santé publique, écologie, énergie, etc.), ce cours est fait pour vous!\n\nEn
        suivant cette première partie du cours, vous explorerez les principes de base
        de la numérisation du territoire et du stockage des géodonnées. Vous apprendrez
        notamment à :\n- Caractériser des objets et/ou phénomènes spatiaux (modélisation
        du territoire) du point de vue de leur positionnement dans l’espace (systèmes
        de coordonnées et projections, relations spatiales) et en fonction de leur
        nature intrinsèque (mode objet ou vecteur vs. mode image ou raster), \n- Utiliser
        les diverses méthodes d’acquisition de données (mesure directe, géoréférencement
        d’images, digitalisation, source de données existantes, etc.)\n- Utiliser
        les divers modes de stockage des géodonnées – Fichiers simples et/ou bases
        de données relationnelles\n- Utiliser des outils de modélisation des données
        pour décrire et implémenter une base de données \n- Créer des requêtes dans
        le langage d’interrogation et de manipulation des données\n\nLa seconde partie
        du cours portera sur les méthodes d''analyse spatiale et les techniques de
        représentation des géo-données. Vous apprendrez notamment à:\n- Analyser les
        propriétés spatiales de variables discrètes, par exemple en quantifiant l’autocorrélation
        spatiale\n- Travailler avec les variables continues (échantillonnage, construction
        de courbes d’isovaleurs, méthodes d’interpolation)\n- Utiliser les modèles
        numériques d''altitude et leurs dérivées (pente, orientation, etc.)\n- Utiliser
        les techniques de superposition de géodonnées et d''interaction entre elles\n-
        Produire des documents cartographiques selon les règles de la sémiologie graphique\n-
        Explorer d’autres formes de représentation spatiale (cartographie interactive
        sur internet, représentations 3D, etc.)\n\nLa page https://www.facebook.com/moocsig

        the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, most scientists
        believed that it should be possible to predict the behavior of any object
        in the universe simply by understanding the behavior of its constituent parts.
        For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom
        in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid
        of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about
        that system’s future.\n\nHowever, there are some systems that defy this notion.
        Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
        along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually
        without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to
        something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider
        life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of
        constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.\n\nThis
        course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials
        science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how
        ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected,
        surprising behaviors.\n\nNote: The fractal image (Sierpinkski Triangle) depicted

        course, part 2 of a 2-course sequence, examines the history of rock, primarily

        This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole
        King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna,
        Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana, and many more artists, with an emphasis
        both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how
        developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways
        in which styles developed. \n\nEmerging out of the experimental and ambitious
        years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in
        the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade,
        punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the hippie aesthetic, as rock
        became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and
        rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson
        and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana

        you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of
        the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income
        or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant
        for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our
        world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\"
        is the first part of a two part course and it includes the following four
        lectures: \n(1) What do we need a state for? \n(2) The Relationship between
        Efficiency and Distributive Justice \n(3) Demonstrating the implications of
        different ethical theories  \n(4) Distributive Justice: measurement and implications\nOnce
        you''ve completed the first part, we strongly recommend that you register
        for the second part entitled: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -
        Maximizing Social Well-being\", as well. Taking both parts of the course would
        enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic
        Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental
        idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply
        the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using
        only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle
        the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and
        unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however
        focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable
        to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence
        of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty,
        gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work
        of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent
        system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social
        welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic
        angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how
        smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats
        to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the
        rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose
        a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major
        figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard''s Elhanan Helpman,
        Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and
        NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able
        to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an
        informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic
        policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection
        between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations
        of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness
        of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies
        being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their
        development, as a conscientious citizen.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/d44a90ad3a11e5a1295552b2c67443/Economic-Growth-_-Distributive-Justice.jpg","id":"0mS2lqJaEeW1Bw7HN8tFsw","slug":"economic-growth-part-1","name":"Economic

        branch of science on how our brain perceives the external world, how our brain
        thinks, how our brain responds to the outside of the world, and how during
        disease or aging the neuronal connections deteriorate. We’re trying to understand
        the molecular, cellular nature and the circuitry arrangement of how nervous
        system works.\n\nThrough this course, you''ll have a comprehensive understanding
        of basic neuroanatomy, electral signal transduction, movement and several

        Berry (1914-2009) was a historian of world religions and an early voice awakening
        moral sensibilities to the environmental crisis.  He is known for articulating
        a “new story” of the universe that explores the implications of the evolutionary
        sciences and cultural traditions for creating a flourishing future.  \n\nThis
        course investigates Berry’s life and thought in relation to the Journey of
        the Universe project.  It draws on his books, articles, and recorded lectures
        to examine such ideas as: the New Story, the Great Work, and the emerging
        Ecozoic era.  The course explores Berry’s insights into cosmology as a context
        for locating the human in a dynamic unfolding universe and thus participating
        in the creative work of our times. In particular, we will examine Berry’s
        reflections on renewal and reform in the areas of ecology, economics, education,
        spirituality, and the arts.\n\n\t\nCourse Rationale:\n\n\tThomas Berry was
        an original, creative, and comprehensive thinker, especially regarding the
        critical nature of our global environmental crisis.  His intellectual importance
        resides in his response to the ecological crisis by bringing together the
        humanities and science in an evolutionary narrative.  In addition, he articulated
        the need for the moral participation of the world religions in addressing
        environmental issues.  He came to this realization largely through his study
        of cosmologies embedded within religious traditions.  Sensing the significance
        of these stories as “functional cosmologies” he explored the widespread influence
        that these stories transmitted through a tradition, for example, in rituals,
        ethics, and subsistence practices.\n\nUpcoming sessions\nOctober 24, 2016

        violence (GBV), including global epidemiology of GBV; health outcomes; seminal
        research; and clinical best practices for GBV prevention, support, and management.
        A core curriculum is supplemented by lectures that contextualize the content
        with specific examples and programs from around the world. The core curriculum
        introduces learners to a global perspective on gender based violence (GBV),
        and includes a review with Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno of the new WHO guidelines
        on responding to violence. Students who wish to receive Honors Recognition
        will complete the honors module, which expands on the core material and highlights
        special circumstances and programs. \n\nThis is an in-depth course with 2
        components: \n1) Core curriculum introduces GBV from a global perspective,
        with an emphasis on ensuring a strong health sector response to GBV and teaching
        key competencies for social workers, physicians, nurses, midwives, community
        health workers, counselors, and other healthcare workers. Completion of the
        core content is required for students to pass the course. \n2) Honors curriculum
        offered by experts from around the world helps students dive deeper into certain
        issues, and touches on unique populations and specialized topics. Completion
        of Honors curriculum is required for those students who wish to receive a
        Certificate of Accomplishment with Honors.\n\nAfter taking the course, students
        will be able to:\n●\tDescribe the global epidemiology of leading forms of
        GBV and the evidence linking GBV to poor health.\n●\tArticulate the challenges,
        strategies, and WHO guidelines for integrating GBV response within the health
        sector. \n●\tDescribe the components of a comprehensive clinical assessment,
        treatment, and management of a GBV survivor.\n●\tDescribe the appropriate
        psychosocial support and management of a GBV survivor.\n\nModule 1 – Introduction
        to GBV- Epidemiology and Health Impact\nGBV comes in a variety of forms, each
        with health consequences for the survivor. An understanding of these issues
        helps inform a comprehensive and multi-sectorial response for preventing and
        responding to GBV. \n\nModule 2 – Health Care Response, Screening, and Psychosocial
        Support\nRecognition of health impacts of GBV has led to calls to address
        GBV within the health sector. Support for GBV survivors extends beyond clinical
        exam and assessment. Safety planning, harm reduction, and access to psychosocial
        support must be ensured. \n\nModule 3 – Clinical Care for GBV Survivors\nCaring
        for GBV survivors requires compassionate, confidential, and nondiscriminatory
        clinical assessment. Competent medical and forensic examination, along with
        appropriate documentation, is essential.\n\nHonors Module – In-Depth Information
        and Special Topics\nThis module provides additional materials for those who
        wish to explore specialized topics and gain a more advanced grasp of the complexities
        of addressing gender-based violence. Core course topics are expanded upon,
        and special populations and programs are highlighted. Special topics include
        violence in humanitarian settings, against adolescents and sex workers, and
        human trafficking. Further information is provided on epidemiology, policy,
        and ethical guidelines, as well as the use of mHealth in GBV screening and
        care. We’ll cover the unique challenges of GBV research, and explore programs
        that encourage men and boys to be engaged in the prevention of violence against
        women. \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis course is a project of the Johns Hopkins

        T.S. Eliot, H.D., Amy Lowell, Hart Crane, Langston Hughes, Muriel Rukeyser,
        and many others—and influential movements. The course mixes historical overview

        of US poetry.\n\nThroughout the course the lectures are illustrated with vivid
        images of the events, people, and places mentioned in the poems themselves.
        Readings by both the poets themselves and experienced faculty highlight the

        this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing on
        the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a twenty-six year
        old patent clerk, introduced in his “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal will
        be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of
        relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person
        and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of
        the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas?
        What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s
        “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially
        seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth
        dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another,
        and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel
        possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of
        light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in
        one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory,
        or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the
        theory of relativity?\n\nAbout the instructor: Dr. Larry Lagerstrom is the

        this project-centered course, you will learn everything you need to research
        and present an effective and persuasive position paper or policy advice. We
        recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading
        and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in
        with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity
        to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations,
        business cases and battles  in an effort to truly understand constructing
        a convincing argument.\n\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant
        ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect
        other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger
        the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that
        advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy
        advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national
        security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it
        takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations.
        But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday
        life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering
        policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline
        of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds
        of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call
        a ‘transferrable skill’.\n\nThe course requires an academic approach, but
        no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and
        advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from
        the experience. \n\nWhat is a policy advice?\nIn its simplest form, a policy
        advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and
        the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to
        adopt your position and to take action on your advice. \n\nWhat advice can
        I give?\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social
        situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy
        or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local
        play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a
        question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with
        others in a similar position.\n\n On the other hand, you might be open for
        suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business
        case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example,
        you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different
        policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively
        you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their
        dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course
        should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as
        amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these
        techniques to their favourite topics.\n\nWhat will I learn?\nThe project-based
        course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The
        assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments
        of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts
        of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way
        and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth.
        During the whole course experience you will learn to:\n•\tFrame a starting
        position for your own research\n•\tUse search engines to locate materials
        required for your advice\n•\tExplore ‘academic’ data-bases\n•\tAnnotate your
        sources correctly\n•\tTarget your research for statistical data\n•\tChoose
        a visualisation for your statistical data \n•\tConstruct an argument in a
        logical manner\n•\tBuild up the logic in each paragraph \n•\tConduct a SWOT
        analysis\n•\tConduct a Risk Analysis\n•\tPresent the materials in a position
        paper\n•\tConvert the position paper to a policy advice\n•\tRecognise the
        policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly \n•\tWrite a powerful
        and effective PowerPoint presentation\n•\tPlace your project in the ‘real
        world’ context of the policy-cycle\n•\tAnd ... Discover a great, great deal
        about your chosen topic.\n\nHow much time will the course take?\nThe lecture
        materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view
        and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but
        these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature
        and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation
        skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some
        use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more
        than an one hour for each module. \nThe project-time depends on the degree
        of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea
        and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately
        four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections,
        then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with
        the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely
        new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or
        so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\n\nAbout

        its operations and markets, each of which is addressed as a separate module
        in the course. In the operations module, the course provides an overview of
        the production of oil and gas, from initial exploration to final transport.
        The second module focuses on the forces that drive the industry''s operations,
        the oil and gas markets, including the cost of wells, seasonal impacts on
        prices, and the role of oil reserves. After every lesson, learners will take

        help you understand the challenges of conservation in Africa and how protected
        areas can help to deal with it, from the local to the international level.\n\nQ:
        How is is this course organised?\nA: This course is composed of 7 thematic
        modules (key concepts, planning, governance, management effectiveness, specificities
        of management, financing, topical issues) that include videos (introduction,
        5 themes, one video on a convention related to PA and conclusion), readings,
        training quizzes (optional) and exams (one per week - compulsory for the certificate).\n\nQ:
        Who present it?\nA: Many speakers share their knowledge and field experience

        What if I want a certificate/diploma at the end?\nA: There are two options
        to receive a certificate and a diploma . 1/ The Coursera certificate . For
        this you must validate all the online exams and pay the certificate to Coursera
        (see previous question). Note that is only a certificate based on online evaluation
        and it does not have as much value and recognition as a real diploma. 2 /
        The EPFL diploma. To receive this diploma you need to take an onsite exam
        organised 2 times a year. You do not need to pass online exams to register
        for the onsite exam. This diploma comes with 2 ECTS (European university credits).\nEPFL
        and IUCN are currently working on the creation of a COS (Certificate of Open
        Studies) composed of several MOOCs, including this one. Only EPFL diplomas
        and credits will be recognised within this COS (no Coursera certificate).
        \n\nQ: How may I exchange with the other participants of this course?\nA:
        A forum will be set up from the beginning of the course to collect questions,
        comments, criticisms and suggestions. The MOOC also a Facebook group in which

        un deux MOOCs. Dans la première partie, le Professeur J.-Ph. Ansermet de l’EPFL

        tous les principes fondamentaux de la thermodynamique.  La deuxième partie

        the United States, two-thirds of the population read at an eighth-grade level
        or below. When it comes to health information, most Americans have the ability
        to read and write at the fifth-grade level. This inter-professional course
        aims to give health professionals the tools needed to improve upon their health
        literacy and communication skills.\n\nThis inter-professional course will
        help educate a variety of health professionals about health literacy efforts
        and improved communication skills. It will require your active participation
        in creating health literate interactions at various organizational levels.
        This course will provide the opportunity to reinforce existing opportunities
        to work together as a multidisciplinary team or fill a gap if you haven’t
        had an opportunity to do so yet!\n\nPlease copy and paste the following link
        into your browser to view our course overview video. http://tinyurl.com/jepeg5e
        \n\nUpon completion of the course, you will be able to:\n\n1.     Define health
        literacy and how it applies to all health disciplines. \n\n2.     List the
        varied factors that influence health literacy and health communication. \n\n3.     Identify
        who is affected by health literacy and health communication. \n\n4.     Recognize
        the consequences of limited health literacy and poor health communication.
        \n\n5.     Determine the stakeholders in health literacy and health communication.
        \n\n6.     Recognize the role of health literacy in meeting core health service
        across disciplines. \n\n7.      Apply strategies to improve health literacy
        at the group, organizational, community, and policy levels\n\nIn addition
        to these course objectives, it is key to the success of the student that participants
        understand their responsibilities of working as a part of an inter-professional
        health care team. The basis of patient-centered care and the foundation of
        the medical home model is that health professionals will learn and implement
        skills to meet the community’s health needs in the context of the community’s
        daily lives—which is their reality! That includes recognizing the social determinants
        of health, such as complex social, economic, environmental, and political
        factors, that impact both the public’s wellness and their health literacy,
        too.\n\nOne initial step – an optional but recommended prerequisite to beginning
        this online course – is to first complete the Centers for Disease Control
        and Prevention’s self-directed online training, “Health Literacy for Public
        Health Professionals”. It provides a good foundation about health literacy
        in three brief, interactive lessons which will take about 1.5-2 hours to complete.\n\nWe
        are also using the Institute of Medicine’s Roundtable on Health Literacy discussion
        paper, “Ten Attributes of Health Literate Health Care Organizations” as a
        guide.  This online course will assist its participants in understanding that
        health literacy needs to be an organizational value and embraced as part of
        the organization’s core business. \n\nA phrase that we often like to use is
        “help a person connect the dots”. By this we mean we need to make sure that
        understanding of health information exists. An example of this would be thinking
        if someone is advised they need to take a medication, or told they need to
        change daily choices and behaviors to improve health that it will simply happen
        as directed. But, there are many necessary steps, strategies, and skills in
        communication for the advice being given to actually happen.  Often, current
        health professionals and health care settings often assume that “one size
        fits all” when it comes to communicating health messages.  This course will
        focus on some approaches to becoming a health literate health care organization
        by using scenarios with actors based on patient experiences, by also letting
        patients share their experiences in their own words, and by offering suggestions
        for improvement in health communication.\n\nWe hope you join us and become
        an agent of change both in your own discipline and as a member of an inter-professional
        team in health care organizations going forward!","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/7a/37449020e911e68db639a792a641b2/HL-Coursera-LOGO.png","id":"dpUAfhO6EeajWgpXwy6yqw","slug":"health-literacy","name":"Health

        people annually by 2030. This open course is designed for people who would
        like to develop an understanding of cancer and how it is prevented, diagnosed,
        and treated.\n\nThe course introduces the molecular biology of cancer (oncogenes
        and tumor suppressor genes) as well as the biologic hallmarks of cancer. The
        course also describes the risk factors for the major cancers worldwide, including
        lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, and
        stomach cancer. We explain how cancer is staged, the major ways cancer is
        found by imaging, and how the major cancers are treated.\n\nIn addition to
        the core materials, this course includes two Honors lessons devoted to cancers
        of the liver and prostate.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you

        aims to explain the Mediterranean, using history and the analysis of the past,

        disclose mobility as a historical factor: a mobility comprised of four major
        elements, namely people, objects, ideas and practices. In our analysis of
        Mediterranean reality between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, from
        the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, we will pay particular attention to
        its western shores, an area seething with transfers and exchanges, in the

        module by introducing the key macroeconomic variables and explaining how they
        are defined and measured in order to enable the students to interpret macroeconomic
        data properly.\n\nIn the second module, the course offers a perspective for
        separating out various parts of the economy driven by different processes
        and for combining those components to develop a richer view of the whole.
        In particular, it applies this approach to the analysis of the relationship
        of the trade deficit with the budget deficit and private savings, offering
        insights about some key determinants of the balance of payments.\n\nThe third
        and fourth modules focus on the analyses of the foreign currency and money
        markets to provide fundamental models of the interest rate and exchange rate
        determination. They also discuss how these variables interact with each other
        and with the macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy and the
        expectations about the future trends in the economy. These analyses lay the
        foundation for more comprehensive models of the macroeconomy in the next course
        of the Managerial Economics and Business Analysis Specialization.\n\nAt the

        adding some of these types of capabilities requires a stronger programming
        language than HTML5 or CSS3, and JavaScript can provide just what you need.  With
        just a basic understanding of the language, you can create a page that will
        react to common events such as page loads, mouse clicks & movements, and even
        keyboard input.      \n\nThis course will introduce you to the basics of the
        JavaScript language.  We will cover concepts such as variables, looping, functions,
        and even a little bit about debugging tools.  You will understand how the
        Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify and modify specific
        parts of your page.  After the course, learners will be able to react to DOM
        Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page.   The class
        will culminate in a  final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5

        or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that
        comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is
        a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus
        and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored
        by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin
        the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten
        traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\n\nThree features
        of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously
        separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new
        dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those
        vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation
        by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in
        an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis
        has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in
        postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central
        bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that
        cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary
        order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key
        derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange
        swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor
        can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial
        theory. That''s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets
        and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers
        of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/b0ac36a966ffee99bfc29ffa4669ac/institute_pgm_1_600x340.jpg","id":"FuHL-RuOEeSduyIAC0iV4g","slug":"money-banking","name":"Economics

        results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning, and more explicit
        statements of assumptions. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations,

        For computing, you have the choice of using Microsoft Excel or the open-source,
        freely available statistical package R, with equivalent content for both options.
        The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as
        explanations of philosophy and interpretation. Completion of this course will

        pourrez donc trouver le niveau d’information qui vous intéresse.\n\nQ : Ce
        cours est-il gratuit ?\nR : L''intégralité des cours ainsi que l''accès aux
        examens, lectures, exercices est entièrement gratuit. Notez cependant que
        Coursera propose un certificat payant (indépendamment de l''EPFL et de l''UICN,
        qui ne sont pas rémunérés par la vente de ces certificats) et fait régulièrement
        des annonces à ce sujet. Si vous ne souhaitez pas passer ce certificat payant
        vous pouvez tout de même accéder à toutes les formalités du cours, passer
        les examens, etc. Il est également possible de demander la gratuité du certificat
        de Coursera (https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid)\n
        \nQ : Comment faire reconnaitre ma formation ?\nR : Deux options s''offrent
        à vous. 1/ Le certificat de Coursera. Pour cela vous devez valider tous les
        examens en ligne et payer le certificat à Coursera (voir question précédente).
        2/ Le certificat de l''EPFL. Pour cela vous devrez passer un examen en présentiel
        organisé 2 fois par an  et il n''est pas nécessaire de valider les examens
        en ligne. Ce diplôme vous permet également d''obtenir 2 crédits ECTS (crédits
        universitaires européens). \nNotez que l''EPFL et l''UICN travaillent actuellement
        à la création d''un diplôme plus complet (COS - Certificat of Open Studies)
        composé de plusieurs MOOC, y compris celui-ci. Pour valider des crédits pour
        le COS seul l''examen présentiel est reconnu.\n\nQ : Comment interagir avec
        les autres inscrits à ce Mooc ?\nR : Un forum sera mis en place dès le début
        du cours permettant de recueillir les questions, les remarques, les critiques
        et les suggestions de tous. Des sujets pouvant faire l’objet de débats seront
        proposés et animés et les participants souhaitant rejoindre le réseau des
        acteurs de la conservation déjà constitué par l’UICN-Papaco pourront le faire
        volontairement. Le MOOC a aussi un groupe Facebook sur lesquels tous les inscrits

        to Avoid Fallacies\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important.
        This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will
        learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all
        and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how
        to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians,
        used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own
        in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will
        be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll
        four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four
        weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability.
        If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next
        session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning
        of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums
        who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be
        taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse
        1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II:
        How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse
        4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWe
        encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look. Politicians, salespeople, and
        children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want
        us to think. Think Again: Fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many
        of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to
        think.\n\nIn this course, you will learn about fallacies. Fallacies are arguments
        that suffer from one or more common but avoidable defects:  equivocation,
        circularity, vagueness, etc. It’s important to learn about fallacies so that
        you can recognize them when you see them, and not be fooled by them. It’s
        also important to learn about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious
        arguments yourself.\n\nSuggested Readings\nStudents who want more detailed
        explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in
        more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal
        Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 13-17, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong
        and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format\nEach week will be divided into multiple
        video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short
        ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer
        graded quiz at the end of the course.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/thinkagain/large-icon.png","id":"wywOj9ZqEeWoww7Hc7148Q","slug":"logical-fallacies","name":"Think

        современной финансовой теории и выходит далеко за рамки интерпретации финансовой
        отчетности компании.  \n\nПрименяя принципы универсальной финансовой теории,
        мы, тем не менее, отразим и специфику российского рынка капитала, который
        относится к группе развивающихся рынков. Курс основан на изучении публичных
        компаний,  однако его концепции применимы к компаниям любой организационно-правовой
        формы.\n\nМы сфокусируемся на анализе ключевых корпоративных решений: решений
        о привлечении капитала и решений об инвестициях. Инвестиционные решения –
        это выбор компанией проектов для долгосрочных вложений. Наша задача : научить
        вас современным методам оценки и критериям выбора инвестиционных проектов.  Решения
        о привлечении капитала – это выбор источников финансирования инвестиций (внутренние
        средства, заемные средства, средства привлеченные путем выпуска новых акций).
        Наша задача – объяснить мотивы выбора конкретной комбинации  инструментов
        финансирования в компании и показать, чем определяется оптимальная структура
        капитала компании (соотношение заемного и собственного капитала).\n\nМы также
        рассмотрим решения компании о выплатах акционерам, и продемонстрируем как

        described below, this is Part B of a 3-part course.  Participants should complete
        Part A first -- Part B \"dives right in\" and refers often to material from
        Part A.]\n\nThis course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming
        languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses
        the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts,
        but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together”
        to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning
        new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about
        programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how
        to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant
        programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply
        than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional
        programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable,
        and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages
        have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and
        beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe
        course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more
        detail in the first module of Part A.  Part B assumes successful completion
        of Part A.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part
        B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A,
        the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the
        three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for
        a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in
        order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  \n\nWeek
        1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the
        course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know
        what all these topics mean.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/64/9607d0528911e6af3d1f5b788773cd/partb_logo_square.png","id":"TCmaO25NEeWdfRLY06XVmw","slug":"programming-languages-part-b","name":"Programming

        you’re an entrepreneur at any stage of your journey, or even an aspiring one,
        and you need money to start or grow your business, this course is for you.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis
        course will introduce, and help you put to use in your startup, the five models
        through which your customers can – and will, if you ask them! – fund your
        business. These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial
        superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly,
        though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood.
        Until now!\n\nThe five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories
        of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around
        the world – including successes and failures – through a series of captivating
        no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too.  \n\nWhy?\n\nMore
        than two generations ago, the venture capital community – VC’s, business angels,
        incubators, and others – convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing
        business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces
        of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes
        astonishing returns they’ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly
        large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. \n\nBut the vast
        majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding.
        Are they onto something that most of today’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has
        missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of
        call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing
        it faster? Perhaps not. \n\nHow?\n\nYou’ll be asked to do a series of exercises
        – out in the real world – to put your growing toolkit to use in your business
        or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business
        start and thrive – without venture capital. You’ll join our discussion board
        of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting

        The Jews and the World\" is the first of the two courses and covers the following
        themes in its three weeks:\n\nWeek 1: From Hatred to Core Ideology\nWe will
        try to delve into Nazi ideology and the special place of Jews and Judaism
        in it. We will also discuss how the National Socialist Party converted the
        German Democracy of the Weimar Republic into a totalitarian regime within
        a short period of time, and its meaning for Jews and non-Jewish citizens.\n\nWeek
        2: The World and the Jews in World War II\nWe will try to examine the broader
        contexts of the Holocaust and to place it, as part of World War 2. In this
        meeting we will also refer to the vital Jewish world to be found under various
        Nazi occupations and influences.\n\nWeek 3: The Isolation Abyss - the Perspective
        of the Individual\nWe will try to reveal different aspects of Jewish life
        in the face of the badge of shame, ghettos and segregation, as well as the
        formation of individual, societies’ and leader’s reactions in the face of
        a consistent policy of dispossession and discrimination.\n\nOnce you’ve completed

        s’agit d’un MOOC sur la crise internationale sur Ebola partie d’Afrique de
        l’Ouest en 2014 ; d’une durée de 5 semaines, où interviendront plus de 30
        professeurs des universités, chercheurs, responsables politiques, autorités
        sanitaires nationales et internationales, membres d’ONGs, et autres acteurs
        d’Europe et d’Afrique sur plus de 60 séquences vidéos. Les thèmes abordés
        se dérouleront selon une séquence hebdomadaire décrite ci-dessous (section
        « plan du cours »).\n\nLe virus Ebola qui a été à l’origine de l’épidémie
        en Afrique de l’Ouest est une souche Zaïre, considérée comme la plus dangereuse.
        Cependant le spectre des tableaux cliniques rencontrés s’est montré très large
        : depuis des formes assez bénignes (pour environ 30% des infections), jusqu’à
        des formes très sévères, presque hors de toute ressources thérapeutiques et
        fréquemment mortelles en une dizaine de jours en moyenne (environ 30%), en
        passant par des formes d’une gravité dépendant de l’infrastructure sanitaire
        responsable de leur prise en charge (c’est-à-dire généralement de bon pronostic
        en cas de bonne prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique). Près de 60%
        des contaminations en Afrique avaient comme origine les rites funéraires non
        sécurisés. Les personnels de santé exposés ont également payé un très lourd
        tribut à l’épidémie. Enfin les conséquences non sanitaires, d’ordre social,
        politique et économique de l’épidémie ont été considérables, tant localement,
        que régionalement ou internationalement. Peu de pays ont connu à ce jour d’importants
        développements de chaînes de contaminations, en dehors de la Guinée, du Libéria
        et du Sierra Leone, mais la situation au Mali à la fin novembre 2014 était
        encore source d’incertitude et d’inquiétude. Les modèles mathématiques, s’ils
        ont été d’un apport précieux dans l’éclairage des politiques publiques, ils
        ont aussi participé à une amplification exagérée du problème, notamment lorsqu’ils
        ont livré des prévisions allant au-delà de plusieurs mois, parfois endossées
        par de grandes agences sanitaires, car elles risquent de se révéler fausses
        et décrédibilisantes.\n\nNous tenterons de mieux savoir quels espoirs on peut
        avoir de disposer d’un vaccin prochainement, et nous essaierons de comprendre
        pourquoi il aura fallu attendre 38 ans, depuis la découverte du virus Ebola,
        pour que la communauté internationale se décide à chercher et développer un
        vaccin contre ce type de virus que l’on savait hautement pathogène et contagieux.
        La réponse internationale a-t-elle été à la hauteur des enjeux ? L’OMS a-t-elle
        pu mettre en œuvre le Règlement Sanitaire International dans des conditions
        satisfaisantes ? Quelle a été la place des ONG dans le règlement du problème
        ? Toutes ces questions feront l’objet, au cours de ce MOOC, de débats et de
        points de vue interdisciplinaires, parfois contradictoires. De même, l’importance
        de la communication, le rôle des médias, la perception du risque par la population
        et par les décideurs eux-mêmes seront analysés. Une large plage sera réservée
        aux réponses aux questions des participants adressées aux orateurs par le
        forum de discussion, afin de réfléchir comment vaincre ensemble Ebola.\n\nPUBLIC
        CIBLE\nCe MOOC est ouvert et gratuit pour tous les publics. Le public cible
        est principalement le milieu des soignants francophones et les acteurs (publics

        הבאים לקורס מבוא למדעי הפסיכולוגיה!\n\nמהי פסיכולוגיה? פסיכולוגיה היא תחום
        מחקר מדעי שמנסה לזהות ולהבין את הגורמים השונים שמשפיעים על האופן שבו בני אדם,
        כלומר אנחנו, מתנהגים בעולם. ההתנהגות שלנו מושפעת מגורמים רבים שכוללים את הסביבה
        שבה אנחנו נמצאים, האישיות שלנו, האופן שבו אנחנו תופסים, זוכרים או מפרשים את
        העולם שסביבנו וכן את נוכחותם ואת דעתם של אנשים אחרים. \n\nלמה הכוונה ״מחקר
        מדעי ? האם פסיכולוגיה היא תחום מדעי?  האם אפשר לחקור רגשות, אישיות וזיכרון
        - מה שנקרא לו ה״מיינד״ - באמצעות אותן השיטות שאנחנו חוקרים כוכבי לכת ובקטריות?
        ולמה זה נחוץ? הרי אנחנו מכירים את עצמינו הכי טוב. אז מדוע יש לחקור את עצמנו
        בכלים כמותיים ומדעיים?\nהתשובה היא שלא רק שאפשר לחקור תהליכים פסיכולוגיים
        בכלים מדעיים אלא שגם מאוד חשוב לעשות זאת. השיטה המדעית משתמשת במדידות כמותיות
        ואובייקטיביות שאינן תלויות באמונות או בדעות של אנשים שונים ובאופן זה מאפשרת
        לנו לנסח תאוריות וחוקים שמנבאים כיצד אנשים יתנהגו במצבים שונים. \n\nבקורס
        שלנו נגלה שבמאה השנים האחרונות מדע הפסיכולוגיה פיתח שיטות מדעיות לחקור מחשבות,
        זיכרונות ורגשות באופן כמותי ואובייקטיבי אפילו אצל תינוקות. בנוסף נשאל, מה
        הקשר בין מוח למיינד, איך אנשים אחרים משפיעים על המחשבות או על ההתנהגות שלנו,
        ממה נובעים ההבדלים הבינאישיים ביכולות, בכישורים או בתכונות האישיות שלנו, ולבסוף
        נבין גם מה קורה במיינד של אנשים שסובלים מהפרעות נפשיות. בקורס נראה שאפילו
        את הטיפול הפסיכולוגי, שבו יושב פסיכולוג מול מטופל על מנת לנסות לשפר את איכות
        חייו, אפשר וצריך לבדוק בכלים מדעיים. \n\nמדע הפסיכולוגיה הוא תחום דינמי שבודק
        את עצמו כל הזמן באמצעות ניסויים אמפיריים ואובייקטיביים, משנה ומעדכן את התאוריות
        שלו בהתאם לממצאים, ואינו נשען על תאוריות שנכתבו לפני עשרות שנים ושמעולם לא
        נבדקו בכלים מדעיים. אני מזמינה אתכם להצטרף אלי לגלות מה יש למדע הפסיכולוגיה

        capacity, a highly disposable product and high fixed costs, hotels are a natural
        candidate for the application of revenue management. Originally developed
        by the airlines in the 1970s, these analytics-based techniques help predict
        consumer behavior at the hotel’s market level so that the hotel can sell each
        room each night at the optimum price. \n\nWith modern-day rising acquisition
        costs and distribution complexities, revenue management techniques have increasingly
        been adopted by both small and large hotel companies, making a comprehensive
        understanding of segmentation, forecasting and pricing an essential requirement
        for today’s hospitality professionals. The purpose of this course is to provide
        a core understanding of the fundamentals of revenue management, which ties
        into the larger picture of revenue strategy. The course is structured to provide
        an insightful look into Revenue Management.\n\nCreated in conjunction with
        Duetto, this course is hosted by a group of revenue management leaders in
        both theory and with hands-on experience at properties around the world. Upon
        completion of the course students should be empowered with industry best practices,
        which can be applied across the vast diversification the hotel industry to

        множество инфекционных заболеваний, причины которых долгие годы казались необъяснимыми.
        Только в последние десятилетия стало понятно: более 70% из них вызваны вирусами.
        Причина большинства случаев рака печени — вирусы гепатитов В и С, рака шейки
        матки – папилломавирусы, более половины случаев диабета 2-го типа обусловлено
        последствиями заражения вирусом краснухи и другими вирусами. Вирусы — это
        то, что касается каждого из нас.\nВ нашем курсе вы узнаете о том, как устроены
        вирусы, чем они отличаются от живых организмов и какие механизмы используют
        для того, чтобы поразить клетки человека. Это поможет вам понять, как работают

        которые имеют вирусную природу. Разобраться в многообразии вирусов вам помогут
        учёные, которые каждый день работают с ними в лабораториях. Они расскажут
        об актуальных проблемах и задачах современной вирусологии, которые у всех

        course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong
        focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around
        the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic
        growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how
        culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in
        countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments
        interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and
        in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the
        government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply
        in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law
        and the regulation of networks.\n\n The course will explore seven topics:\n\n
        1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look
        at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975,
        the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors,
        then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look
        at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition
        between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem
        of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The
        1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and
        started the path to Microsoft''s powerful position and eventual monopoly in
        that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases
        against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices;
        (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape
        Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and
        (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the
        point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and
        the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to
        assess how these cases influenced that competition.\n\n 2.      Google Emerges
        (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms
        of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators
        throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can
        be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past
        mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales
        plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later
        page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators
        have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade
        Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations
        of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.\n\n 3.      Smartphones.
        The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile
        and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we
        have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and
        the Blackberry to Apple''s iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android
        platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily
        complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to
        free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard
        setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard
        and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the
        regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against
        Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple''s lawsuit against Samsung over utility
        and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look
        at the European Commission''s investigation into the Android platform.\n\n
        4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1
        billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion
        and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law
        and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating
        the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination
        obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same,
        discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks.
        We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications
        network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular
        at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will
        consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce
        sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and
        will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.\n\n 5.      The Day
        the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise
        of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We
        start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought
        recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn
        to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing
        rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated
        with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio
        tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home
        Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the
        creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies
        such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology
        by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched
        from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple
        and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple''s
        music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription
        services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its
        purchase of Beats.\n\n 6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some
        of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video
        has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law
        issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to
        the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually
        the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable
        TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome
        for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering
        that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark
        creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and
        will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider
        the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight
        over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with
        a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast
        television.\n\n 7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books
        with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the
        printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering
        a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in
        technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues
        about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself.
        We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright
        fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And
        we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/de/bced60f7f111e49914553f5bc0e2a1/Internet-Sign.jpg","name":"Internet

        prevalence of these conditions together with the long incubation period of
        the chronic diseases and the restless technological innovations, offer new
        opportunities to develop strategies for early diagnosis.\nIt is an important

        Technical innovations in networks, sensors and applications, coupled with
        the advent of ''smart machines'' have resulted in a huge diversity of devices
        generating all kinds of structured and unstructured data that needs to be
        processed somewhere.  Collecting and understanding that data, combining it
        with other sources of information and putting it to good  use can be achieved
        by using connectivity, analytical and cognitive services now available on
        the cloud, allowing development and deployment of solutions to be achieved
        faster and more efficiently than ever before.\n\nThis course is an entry level
        introduction to developing and deploying solutions for the Internet of Things.
        It will focus on capturing data from a trusted device and sending the data
        to a cloud platform where it can be exploited by the many services available.
        You will explore all the steps required to create a basic IoT solution using
        a popular device, the Raspberry Pi, and a trial version of the cloud-based
        IBM Watson IoT Platform. \n\nWhat you will learn: \nQuickly create applications
        that leverage connectivity and analytics as part of an integrated IoT platform.  Use
        Node-RED, an open-source visual application development environment, on both
        the device and the cloud.  Create a basic IoT solution by leveraging pre-built
        blocks of code that abstracts and speeds the development process. Use APIs
        to access the platform and explore the different connectivity options for
        various devices, gateways and applications. Explore options to ensure your
        solution makes best use of the captured data. \n \nWhat technology is required
        to complete the course?  \nThe programming assignments require you to have
        a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. The
        course also uses the SenseHAT extension board, whilst it is preferable to
        have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can''t get a SenseHAT.  \n\nYou
        will need internet connectivity to download software, connect to the platform,
        develop and deploy your IoT solution.\n\nYour Rasberry Pi will need the latest
        Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size
        of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with
        a preconfigured SD card.\n\nIn order to setup the Micro SD card, you will
        need a computer with either a windows, apple or Linux OS. Since most computer
        do not have a micro SD port, you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro
        SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.\n\nTo
        work on your Raspberry Pi, you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as
        the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect
        the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI
        cable).\nYour Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either
        an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router, or a USB WiFi dongle if you
        have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in
        WiFi\nA USB Keyboard and mouse.\n\nYour Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V
        micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)\nThere is
        an IoT Learner kit available from element14 which includes the Raspberry Pi,
        a pre-flashed SD card, a case and power supply : https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit
        \n\nWhat prerequisite skills are required ?\nThis is an entry level course,
        but does assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use
        both Python and JavaScript programming languages, so some basic skill in these
        languages is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM
        Watson IoT Platform is required.\n\nWhat additional resources do I need for
        this course? \nThe Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Bluemix
        cloud platform, so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform.\n\nWhen
        your 30-day trial expires, you can enter a credit card to keep using Bluemix.
        Bluemix has a set amount of free resources available to users who have registered
        with their credit card. If you stay within these free resources limits you
        will not incur any charges. This is a good idea if you are planning to take
        longer than 30 days to complete the course, or if you have an existing trial
        account that that is about to expire and you need longer time on the platform
        to complete the course.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5b/388f10065c11e6958e7b7f4c6a2563/Watson-IoT-thumbnail.jpg","id":"iRl53_BWEeW4_wr--Yv6Aw","slug":"developer-iot","name":"A

        fijación de precios es una de las decisiones de marketing más importantes,
        pero menos entendidas. Aprenda y practique conceptos y técnicas, y conozca
        las últimas reflexiones en materia de evaluación y formulación de estrategias
        de fijación de precios. Analice el modo en que las empresas tratan de captar
        valor, además de beneficios, en los ingresos que obtienen. \n\nTras este curso,
        podrá participar activamente en el proceso de formulación de estrategias de
        fijación de precios de sus propios productos y servicios, o de los de su empresa.
        Este curso también pone el foco en la dinámica de la fijación de precios y
        la reacción de los competidores. Como tal, se utiliza un enfoque muy pragmático
        y directamente aplicable al día a día de su vida profesional. \n\nEste curso
        se compone de los cuatro módulos siguientes:\n\n1 - En este módulo, empezaremos
        por la importancia de la fijación de precios, en especial, para el resultado
        neto. Teniendo esto en mente, y tras demostrar cómo la fijación de precios
        es el factor conductor más importante de la rentabilidad, cuando termine este
        módulo podrá llevar a cabo fijaciones de precios basadas en clientes, en la
        competencia y en costes. Asimismo, podrá utilizar los conceptos de elasticidad
        del precio y el precio óptimo al fijar los precios de sus productos y servicios.
        \n\n2 - Tras finalizar este módulo, podrá aprovechar los cuatro métodos distintos
        para determinar la disposición a pagar de los clientes. Ya se utilicen opciones
        como datos de mercado o experimentos (basados en observación) o encuestas
        a expertos o clientes (basadas en encuestas), podrá utilizar esta información
        para identificar el precio óptimo.\n\n3 - Lo que vemos en el mundo real es
        que las empresas no cobran un mismo precio por todos sus productos, sino más
        bien que fijan precios distintos para productos diferentes con respecto a
        los diversos segmentos de clientes. Tras estudiar las ventajas de la discriminación
        de precios (y el significativo potencial en cuanto a ingresos y beneficios
        que conlleva), podrá entender el tipo de discriminación de precios y la forma
        de implantarlo en sus productos y servicios.\n\n4 - En este módulo final,
        hablaremos de la psicología que hay detrás de la fijación de precios. De esta
        forma, podrá «manipular» a los clientes de modo que perciban un valor superior
        en los productos y servicios que produce, o les cueste menos pagar el precio
        de compra de sus productos.  Tendrá a su disposición diversas maneras de maximizar
        sus ventas, ingresos y rentabilidad. También realizaremos un par de experimentos
        con clientes voluntarios para ver cómo el precio afecta en las percepciones,
        y cómo puede beneficiarse de ello.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/775d1023f311e6a314494b1e45d0f5/estrategia-de-precios.jpg","id":"eQ2a1KTsEeWkKArXiJndEw","slug":"estrategia-precios","name":"Estrategia

        neuroscience, to psychotherapy and politics, the ways we engage with music
        can make all the difference. Music has always played an integral role in the
        lives of individuals and communities all around the globe. This course explores
        the ways that music can be used to achieve positive changes with a particular
        emphasis on the most vulnerable persons. Six different understandings will
        be explored, each with their own set of values and assumptions. The greatest
        thinkers in each approach believe that their way of explaining the power of
        music is right, but we will show that understanding music in its entirety
        delivers the best results in each unique circumstance. Once we understand
        the various ways that music can change the world, we can make informed decisions
        about how best to employ its extraordinary power.\n\nLearners who engage in
        this MOOC can expect to both deepen and broaden their understanding of how
        music can be used with individuals, groups and communities. Specifically:
        • To distinguish between how music works on the body, in the brain, through
        the unconscious, for bonding, as political action and in reflecting culture,

        the world, we find ourselves facing global epidemics of obesity, Type 2 Diabetes
        and other predominantly diet-related diseases. To address these public health
        crises, we urgently need to explore innovative strategies for promoting healthful
        eating. There is strong evidence that global increases in the consumption
        of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation
        of food in the home, have contributed to high rates of preventable, chronic
        disease. In this course, learners will be given the information and practical
        skills they need to begin optimizing the way they eat. This course will shift
        the focus away from reductionist discussions about nutrients and move, instead,
        towards practical discussions about real food and the environment in which
        we consume it. By the end of this course, learners should have the tools they
        need to distinguish between foods that will support their health and those
        that threaten it. In addition, we will present a compelling rationale for
        a return to simple home cooking, an integral part of our efforts to live longer,
        healthier lives.\n\nView the trailer for the course here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7x1aaZ03xU","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b0/aae5e0b59611e58ae18543e6165465/fruit-bowl.jpg","id":"xMqZG1wyEeWd6BJKWlaBIw","slug":"food-and-health","name":"Stanford

        you wish to know how to analyze and solve business and economic questions
        with data analysis tools? Then Econometrics by Erasmus University Rotterdam
        is the right course for you, as you learn how to translate data into models
        to make forecasts and to support decision making.\n\n* What do I learn?\nWhen
        you know econometrics, you are able to translate data into models to make
        forecasts and to support decision making in a wide variety of fields, ranging
        from macroeconomics to finance and marketing. Our course starts with introductory
        lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special
        interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice
        data, and time series data.  You learn these key topics in econometrics by
        watching the videos with in-video quizzes and by making post-video training
        exercises. \n\n* Do I need prior knowledge?\nThe course is suitable for (advanced
        undergraduate) students in economics, finance, business, engineering, and
        data analysis, as well as for those who work in these fields. The course requires
        some basics of matrices, probability, and statistics, which are reviewed in
        the Building Blocks module. \n\n* What literature can I consult to support
        my studies?\nYou can follow the MOOC without studying additional sources.
        Further reading of the discussed topics (including the Building Blocks) is
        provided in the textbook that we wrote and on which the MOOC is based: Econometric
        Methods with Applications in Business and Economics, Oxford University Press.
        The connection between the MOOC modules and the book chapters is shown in
        the Course Guide – Further Information – How can I continue my studies.\n\n*
        Will there be teaching assistants active to guide me through the course?\nStaff
        and PhD students of our Econometric Institute will provide guidance in January
        and February of each year. In other periods, we provide only elementary guidance.
        We always advise you to connect with fellow learners of this course to discuss
        topics and exercises.\n\n* How will I get a certificate?\nTo gain the certificate
        of this course, you are asked to make six Test Exercises (one per module)
        and a Case Project. Further, you perform peer-reviewing activities of the
        work of three of your fellow learners of this MOOC. You gain the certificate

        the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\n\nThis free online course
        was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem – the World Center
        for Holocaust Research. This course is the second of the two courses and covers
        three themes in its three weeks:\n\nWeek 1: The Final Solution\nWe’ll look
        at the cultural and mental processes that paved the way to the comprehensive
        and systematic mass murder of Jews in Europe – that is, the Final Solution.
        As part of this hard lesson we will discuss the various characteristics of
        the murder sites and death camps, and reveal selected aspects of the horror
        that occurred in them. \n\nWeek 2: Jewish and Non-Jewish Responses to the
        Holocaust\nWe will try to explore questions regarding knowledge about the
        application of the Final Solution, as well as a variety of responses and annihilation
        of victims, local populations and perpetrators.\n\nWeek 3: The End of the
        War\nWe will dedicate this lesson to the events that occurred in the last
        years of the Holocaust, as well as questions of memory, commemoration and
        future research. \n\nWe strongly recommend that you register for \"The Holocaust
        - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the World\" as
        well. Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller
        and more comprehensive knowledge about The Holocaust.\n\nThis online course

        понятием «культура» можно подразумевать различные нормы поведения, материальное
        наследие, отрасль производства или сферу управления, схожие привычки и традиции
        поведения внутри социальных общностей. Широкий спектр сегодняшних значений
        оформлялся в течение длительного времени, пройдя путь от «культуры» в значении
        возделывании земли у античных авторов до сегодняшнего многозначного термина.
        Предлагаемый курс «Философия культуры» нацелен на передачу подробной и структурированной
        хронологии философских учений о культуре, освоение базового концептуального
        аппарата и рассмотрение механизмов взаимодействия человека и культуры / раскрытие
        специфики философии культуры как объяснительной модели. Содержание лекций
        выстраивается вокруг сюжетов о морфологии различных типов культур от античности
        до современности. Особое внимание уделяется западноевропейской культуре Нового
        времени.\n\n\nВ результате освоения материалов курса «Философия культуры»
        студент будет знать:\n•\tосновные исторические типы философских теорий культуры,
        их своеобразие, логику их построения;\n•\tосновные проблемы и парадоксы, связанные
        с опытом построения теорий культуры.\n\nИ уметь:\n•\tвыявлять в разнородном
        эмпирическом материале культур закономерности их развития,         \n•\tвидеть связи ряда тенденций современной культуры с исторической традицией.\n\nКурс
        «Философия культуры» носит вводный характер рассчитан на широкий круг слушателей,
        вне зависимости от наличия у них профильного гуманитарного образования, интересующихся
        культурой как предметом научного знания. \n\nAbout this course:\nThe notion
        of “culture” may imply various behavioral norms, areas of production or management,
        similar habits and traditions within social groups. The wide spectrum of multiple
        meanings has been developing over a long period of time, starting with land
        cultivation as the first meaning of culture (according to antique authors)
        and resulting in a modern multivocal notion of culture. The “Philosophy of
        Culture” course is focused on delivering the detailed and structured chronology
        of philosophical teachings about culture, mastering the basic conceptual apparatus,
        and familiarization with the mechanisms of interactions between culture and
        humanity, revealing philosophy of culture features as an explanatory model.
        The content of lectures is built around subjects that concern the morphology
        of different types of cultures from the antique times to modernity with the
        emphasis on the Western-Europe culture of the Modern Age.\n\nUpon the completion
        of the “Philosophy of Culture” course the student will know:\n•\tThe main
        historical types of the philosophical theories of culture, their specifics,
        the logic of their construction\n•\tThe major problems and paradoxes concerning
        the experience of constructing theories of the philosophy of culture\n\nAlso
        he or she will be able to:\n•\tDiscover the patterns of cultural development
        within the heterogeneous empiric environment. \n•\tTo see the connections
        between the series of modern cultural trends and the historical tradition\n\nWho
        this course is for:\nThis introductory course might be interesting for the
        Humanity students, as well as for anyone who is starting to study theory and
        history of culture. The “Philosophy of Culture” is designed for the wide audience
        interested in culture as a subject of scientific knowledge and does not require
        a completed major in the Humanities.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/55/dddac05e8d11e487da13d17b09f3e9/philculture1.png","id":"lznOiR08EeagBBLYvz0q6w","slug":"filosofiya-kultury","name":"Философия

        timeline, and how you expect to complete it.\n\nMilestone 2: Workflow Design
        - Develop the analysis workflow for your project, which will typically involve
        creating at least one core algorithm for processing your data. The model need
        not be complex or complicated, but it should allow you to analyze spatial
        data for a new output or to create a new analytical map of some type.\n\nMilestone
        3: Data Analysis – Obtain and preprocess data, run it through your models
        or other workflows in order to get your rough data products, and begin creating

        growing number of software programs, it seems as if anyone can make a webpage.
        But what if you actually want to understand how the page was created? There
        are great textbooks and online resources for learning web design, but most
        of those resources require some background knowledge. This course is designed
        to help the novice who wants to gain confidence and knowledge. We will explore
        the theory (what actually happens when you click on a link on a webpage?),
        the practical (what do I need to know to make my own page?), and the overlooked
        (I have a page, what do I do now?). Throughout the course there will be a
        strong emphasis on adhering to syntactic standards for validation and semantic
        standards to promote wide accessibility for users with disabilities.  The
        textbook we use is available online, “The Missing Link: An Introduction to
        Web Development and Programming” by Michael Mendez from www.opensuny.org.
        \n\nThis course will appeal to a wide variety of people, but specifically
        those who would like a step-by-step description of the basics. There are no
        prerequisites for this course and it is assumed that students have no prior
        programming skills or IT experience. The course will culminate in a small
        final project that will require the completion of a very simple page with
        links and images. The focus of this course is on the basics, not appearance.
        You can see a sample final page at http://intro-webdesign.com/html5-plain.html.  \n\nThis
        is the first course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization. Subsequent

        science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. It
        closely parallels the brick-and-mortar course given to the freshmen at the
        University of Colorado at Boulder. The course covers classical mechanics,
        including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications. ","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/6d/f6613e9892e60add07be5d4876cf2d/CourseraLogo.jpg","name":"Physics

        The focus of this course is on math - specifically, data-analysis concepts
        and methods - not on Excel for its own sake. We use Excel to do our calculations,
        and all math formulas are given as Excel Spreadsheets, but we do not attempt
        to cover Excel Macros, Visual Basic, Pivot Tables, or other intermediate-to-advanced
        Excel functionality.\n\nThis course will prepare you to design and implement
        realistic predictive models based on data. In the Final Project (module 6)
        you will assume the role of a business data analyst for a bank, and develop
        two different predictive models to determine which applicants for credit cards
        should be accepted and which rejected. Your first model will focus on minimizing
        default risk, and your second on maximizing bank profits. The two models should
        demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice
        of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.\n\nThe second big
        idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot
        and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst
        is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment,
        while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate
        and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used
        in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information,
        and confidence intervals for linear regression.\n\nAll the data you need is
        provided within the course, all assignments are designed to be done in MS
        Excel, and you will learn enough Excel to complete all assignments. The course
        will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly
        used business functions, and you’ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality
        you might need in the future (module 1).\n\nThe course does not cover Visual
        Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments.
        All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates
        that you can use to answer relevant questions. You will emerge with substantial
        vocabulary and practical knowledge of how to apply business data analysis
        methods based on binary classification (module 2), information theory and
        entropy measures (module 3), and linear regression (module 4 and 5), all using
        no software tools more complex than Excel.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/2407703cf611e58fafd36fa641b2ed/CourseraIcons.Square1200.2.jpg","id":"SpO4HBnoEeWjrA6seF25aw","slug":"analytics-excel","name":"Mastering

        учебный курс посвящен истории Санкт-Петербурга с момента его основания в 1703
        году до отъезда большевистского правительства в Москву в 1918 году. В задачи
        курса входит освещение политической, культурной, экономической жизни города
        в контексте развития Российской империи в течение двух столетий. Пройдя курс,
        слушатель узнает об истории создания Петербурга, его застройке, расцвете и
        трудностях, а также познакомится с основными событиями российской истории.
        В курсе показаны сложные процессы и трансформации внутренней политики российских
        императоров и то, как это отражалось на жизни имперской столицы и ее жителей.
        Особое внимание в лекциях уделено тому, как на протяжении веков менялся внешний
        облик города, рассказывается об архитекторах и скульпторах, создавших образы
        Петербурга. Кроме того, отдельные сюжеты курса посвящены развитию культуры
        и искусства и повседневной жизни петербуржцев. Город предстает перед слушателями
        как живой организм, сыгравший ключевую роль в истории России и Европы. Курс

        relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For many musicians,
        he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and
        profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the
        interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers.
        At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to millions of people
        who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two
        hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still
        represents its summit.\n\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano
        sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on
        one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might
        include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the
        composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music;
        his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often
        surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional
        process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature
        some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a
        player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work
        of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s
        music itself. \n\nThis season''s Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson
        in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson. \n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon

        базовом курсе микроэкономики рассказывается об основных инструментах экономического
        анализа, которые позволяют изучать наиболее важные закономерности в поведении
        людей и фирм. У людей есть предпочтения относительно товаров и бюджетные ограничения,
        у фирм – производственные возможности и спрос на их продукцию со стороны людей.
        В результате взаимодействия людей и фирм складываются рынки, на которых определяется
        цена – важнейший канал передачи информации.\n\nЧтобы информации было больше,
        существуют рынки, на которых продаются и покупаются товары и услуги. Потребитель
        никогда не купит нужный ему товар, если не узнает, где и как его можно купить.
        Производитель не станет его изготавливать, если не будет уверен, что найдется
        покупатель, который его приобретет. Каждый человек и каждая фирма обладает
        какими-то сведениями – прежде всего о себе самом, о своих вкусах, интересах,
        потребностях и возможностях. Однако информации у всех становится во много
        раз больше, когда субъекты начинают взаимодействовать – производят и потребляют,
        продают, покупают и меняются. Поведение людей и фирм на рынках – основной
        предмет изучения в курсе микроэкономики.\n\nВ ходе курса студенту предстоит
        еженедельно просмотреть видео лекций преподавателя общей длительностью 60-80

        2\nModule 2: Financial system & financial assets: fixed income securities\nIn
        this and the next two modules, we cover the key institutional features of
        financial markets and instruments. We ask the following questions: Why do
        financial markets exist? What role do they play? What are financial assets
        and how are they different than real assets? How does it all come together?
        Basically, this is where I hope you will get to see the big picture of the
        entire financial system and how it comes together.\nModule 2 focuses on fixed
        income securities. We''ll get started with a review of basics of bond valuation.
        You will learn about short-term money market instruments, U.S. Treasury securities
        as well as corporate bonds. After module 2, you will be able to describe fixed
        income securities, be familiar with their institutional features, and identify
        their cash flows. Finally, you will learn how to value fixed income securities
        such as Treasury bills, zero-coupon or coupon-bonds and compute yields.\n\nTopics
        covered include:\n•\tExplain the roles of financial markets\n•\tDistinguish
        between real and financial assets\n•\tDefine and explain money market instruments,

        Module 3, we continue our overview of financial markets and instruments. We
        next focus on two other major asset classes: equity securities and derivative
        instruments. You will learn about how equity differs from fixed income securities,
        the cash flows associated with stock and preferred stock and how to find the
        value of a share. You will also learn about option strategies. After completing
        module 3, you will be able to describe all major asset classes, including
        derivative instruments such as options, forwards and futures. You will be

        course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses
        in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses,
        and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software
        code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need
        for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more
        complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility
        allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather
        than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility
        makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually
        conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical

        mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented
        analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the
        course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze
        and improve processes in a variety of domains.\n\nData science is the profession
        of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in
        a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage
        and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process
        analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process
        analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques)
        and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining.
        Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed
        behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This
        technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any
        type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications
        include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service
        processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers
        using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving
        the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in
        common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence,
        we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the
        key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various
        process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process
        models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that
        use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use
        software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the
        theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an
        overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision
        making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process
        mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The
        course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe
        course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\nThe first type of
        process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and
        produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example
        is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model
        (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\nThe second type
        of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared
        with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to
        check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\nThe
        third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or
        improve an existing process model using information about the actual process
        recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment
        between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing
        or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process
        model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining
        techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter
        is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance
        at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time
        prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining
        processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess
        mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process
        management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\"
        and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining
        helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information
        systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event
        logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course,
        one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of
        the Business Process Intelligence field.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/68f1b0d03511e386f43790e29f1243/dreamstime_l_21055560.jpg","id":"SN5tm_tBEeScRyIAC3-PxA","slug":"process-mining","name":"Process

        financial support it can get from the financial system through venture capital
        investment.\n\nThe course tries to discover how special financial intermediaries
        (called private equity investors) finance through equity companies belonging

        interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory,
        the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice,
        the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development
        of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation
        of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as
        neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores
        in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese

        musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century
        Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art)
        as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what
        is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course
        aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century
        Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge

        Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explores the immense variety of meditation
        practices past and present. We present their histories, their philosophical
        underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give
        you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations
        designed just for this course. \n\nWe use a traditional, if overly simplistic,
        way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices
        into “three vehicles”, three programs of theory and practice supporting the
        personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative
        in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (Hīnayāna), (ii) the Great Vehicle
        (Mahāyāna), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajrayāna), also referred to
        as “esoteric Buddhism” or “Buddhist tantra”. To this, we will add a fourth
        Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term
        ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus
        term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”. We follow an indigenous
        Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational
        paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These
        twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course’s discussion
        of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.\n\nThe five modules of
        the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives,
        treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components:
        (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice;
        (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices,
        principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis;
        (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations
        in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv)
        secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations
        or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles
        underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/88/dca9404aca11e5ab88a912c019e599/buddha.jpg","id":"aaNxjzc9EeWO-Qq6rEZAow","slug":"buddhist-meditation","name":"Tibetan

        course, is entirely on matrix algebra and applications. Specifically, the
        studies include systems of algebraic equations including the existence and
        uniqueness of solutions, determinants and how they arise naturally, eigenvalue
        problems with their applications to diagonalization and matrix functions.
        The course is designed in the same spirit as the first one with a “content
        based” emphasis, answering the “why” and “where“ of the topics, as much as
        the traditional “what” and  “how” leading to “definitions” and “proofs”.\n\nChapters:\nChapter

        Drucker, a pioneer in the field of management, once said that people have
        a perverse tendency to behave like human beings. Of course, we are not machines,
        and certainly not programmable. But through the study of organizational behavior,
        we can gain insights into what makes people tick within a work context. Increasing
        your understanding of your own behavior and that of your colleagues, teams
        and leaders, is an important first step to bringing positive change to how
        you and your organization work.\n\nThe objective of this course is therefore
        to provide insight into four key areas:\n •\tMotivation. In this course segment
        we will understand the concept of motivation and review various perspectives
        that will help you understand how we can motivate others. \n•\tLeadership.
        In this part of the course, we will analyze the concept of leadership and
        consider various perspectives and approaches to help shed light on leadership
        emergence and effectiveness.\n•\tTeamwork. Here we look at team functioning
        and effectiveness. Using the widely used input – process – output model of
        team effectiveness, we consider such topics as team diversity, team processes,
        and team outcomes.\n•\tCulture. Finally, we''ll move to the level of the organization
        and consider the concept of organizational culture, also touching upon the
        concept of national culture. We look at the various ways in which culture
        is expressed, and discuss the implications of culture for people within organizations
        and cross-cultural collaborations.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d3/66cec080cd11e6b269374f4719bd53/Mooc_FM_1-OK-4.png","id":"SKOeUY7CEeW2aQ7olstw0Q","slug":"managing-people-iese","name":"Organizational

        on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family,
        landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the
        key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts.
        Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement.
        \n\nI hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have
        made “Successful Negotiation” one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs
        worldwide.  In the course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps
        to a successful negotiation: \n\n   (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy
        \n\n   (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success \n\n   (3) Close: Create
        a Contract \n\n   (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game \n\nTo successfully
        complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to
        do the following: \n\n(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes).
        The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding
        of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to
        match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can
        watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who
        binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another
        learner compared the course to “House of Cards.”  Both shows contain interesting
        examples of complex negotiations!\n\n(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing
        the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use
        Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation
        partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with
        your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools
        that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available
        at http://negotiationplanner.com/ \n\n(3) Take the final exam. To successfully
        complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam
        is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want
        until you master the material. \n\nCourse Certificate\nYou have the option
        of earning a Course Certificate.  A Certificate provides formal recognition

        of the most significant changes in the world in the past 30 years is the opening
        of China to the outside world and its engagement with that world. In the initial
        years of the opening, external forces influenced China’s economy, regional
        balances, bureaucracy, as well as the political authority of local leaders
        in the coastal areas. More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a
        rising China which seeks resources and talent from all around the globe and
        uses its financial wealth to strengthen its position in the world. This course
        tracks the opening of China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing
        on how the world affected China’s internal development. We then look at various

        to Understanding Memory: Explaining the Psychology of Memory through Movies.
        Someone once said that memory is fascinating because sometimes we forget what
        we want to remember, sometimes we remember what we want to forget, and sometimes
        we remember events that never happened or never happened the way we remember
        them. I want to show you how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what
        we can do to enhance memory function, especially as we get older. Rather than
        covering all aspects of human memory, I will provide an introduction to the
        scientific study of memory by focusing on a select group of topics that hold
        widespread popular appeal. \n\nAll of my lectures will describe what has been
        learned about memory in a nontechnical way for people with no prior background
        in psychology. To facilitate your understanding, I will use clips from numerous
        films to illustrate different aspects of memory. Many of us love watching
        movies because they offer an unparalleled opportunity for entertainment, even
        if entertaining films are not always scientifically accurate. Still, I believe
        that we can learn a lot about memory from popular films, if we watch them
        with an educated eye. \n\nThis course is based on my new book from MIT Press
        - Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory. While it is not
        required for the course, it can enhance your understanding of memory by providing
        a thorough coverage of the topics that I describe as well as additional fascinating
        aspects of memory covered only in the book. This book is available in either
        hardcopy or ebook form and MIT Press is offering a 30% discount off the cover

        how to calculate them, but also how to evaluate them. This course will also
        prepare you for the next course in the specialization - the course Inferential
        Statistics. \n\nIn the first part of the course we will discuss methods of
        descriptive statistics. You will learn what cases and variables are and how
        you can compute measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and dispersion
        (standard deviation and variance). Next, we discuss how to assess relationships
        between variables, and we introduce the concepts correlation and regression.
        \n\nThe second part of the course is concerned with the basics of probability:
        calculating probabilities, probability distributions and sampling distributions.
        You need to know about these things in order to understand how inferential
        statistics work. \n\nThe third part of the course consists of an introduction

        will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive
        statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit. The issue of dimensionality
        of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating
        those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive
        models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn
        predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to
        data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will

        learn how to evaluate the influence of organizations around you and how to
        transform your relationships to reach a stronger coherence.\n\nDo you feel
        sometime that the world around you is disorganized? Can you make sense of
        all the information at your reach and have an impact on this situation? Have
        you ever thought that this conundrum may be due to all the organizations that
        emerge, strive or wane, and disappear every day? \n\nOrganizations are ubiquitous,
        from clubs and associations to firms and public agencies. Organizations confer
        meaning to all of us, and our attachment and membership to organizations have
        a profound effect on all areas of our lives. But in our increasingly turbulent
        world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy,
        steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.\n\nThis course develops an
        integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed
        ‘orgology’. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect
        and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing,
        organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society,
        thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.  \n\nIn turn, individuals,
        you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations
        and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of
        understanding organizations’ relationships with society results in reconsidering
        management and the role of individuals in building their future.\n\nThere

        years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including
        web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents,
        and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and
        tweets. Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by
        humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable
        for discovering knowledge about people’s opinions and preferences, in addition
        to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. \n\nThis course will
        cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data
        mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the
        raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively
        small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential
        tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large
        text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret
        any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant
        original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn

        the past, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) were programs used only by audio
        engineers with a highly specific knowledge base, on machines inaccessible
        to most people. But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording
        music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the
        masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range
        of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers,
        producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings,
        but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth,
        and elsewhere.\n\nIn this course, you will explore some of Live’s most powerful
        and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing,
        looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting.
        Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs
        in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge
        base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording.
        The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and
        encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not
        own Ableton Live 9, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live

        course will cover the topics of a full year, two semester General Chemistry
        course.  We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies
        in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. \n\nThe fundamental
        concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach
        developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts
        you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather
        than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize
        or apply them.\n\nSo why use this approach? \n\nOne reason is that most of
        us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations
        and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in
        Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from,
        we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. \n\nA second
        reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in
        particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates
        those reasoning processes.  \n\nA third reason is that this is simply more
        interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles
        to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually
        when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers
        to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\nRecommended Background: \nThe class
        can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some
        prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover
        some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class
        would be helpful.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nReadings will be assigned from the
        on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via
        Rice’s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any
        of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.  A particularly good free
        on-line resource is Dickerson, Gray, and Haight, \"Chemical Principles, 3rd
        Edition\".  Links to these two texts will be available in the Introduction

        so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious
        disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying
        of an infectious disease before you''ve reached the tender age of 5 would
        have been extremely high. \n \nSince then, science has come a long way in
        understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how
        they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis,
        or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases
        are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving.
        Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing
        their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we''ll
        explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\n\nAfter we’ve covered
        the basics, we''ll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we''re worried
        about flu pandemics. We''ll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases
        such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated,
        but are now making a comeback. We''ll explore Malaria, and use it as a case

        networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends''
        friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too.

        development environment provided by the population of learners. At the point
        of the capstone course your thousands of fellow learners become consultants
        capable of refining and adding value to your business concept, they may also
        be potential customers or at the very least allow you to observe the likely

        molecules; genetic manipulations such as knockdown or overexpression of single
        genes; manipulation of the extracellular microenvironment conditions, for
        example, growing cells on different surfaces, and more. These perturbations
        are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent
        stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons
        or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that
        are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables
        are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular
        phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology. The BD2K-LINCS Data
        Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is commissioned to organize, analyze,
        visualize and integrate this data with other publicly available relevant resources.

        focus on gaining a competitive edge on the job market by investigating new
        opportunities for career growth, conducting a thorough audit of your skill-building

        and development facility where you will engage in career investigation research,
        self-audit, and creating evidence-based portfolios, professional development
        plans, self-marketing and personal branding strategies, presentations, and
        public profiles;\n•\tYou’ll be actively working with your cohort (study group
        members) to review their work and receive peer feedback;\n•\tYou may also
        use the Capstone as a “career fitness gym” and work independently on a project
        where you will share your results with others and receive peer feedback. Examples
        of these projects include but are not limited to developing a self-marketing
        plan, creating a new digital artifact, developing communication strategy,
        working on a job application, creating a selection criteria statement, and
        looking for best practices and self-assessment tools;\n•\tIt is completely
        self-paced; you may want to either do it as a 4-week course, or focus and

        organize yourself, fine tune your self-management information system, provide
        a framework for strategic self-management, and serve as an effective self-coaching

        MOOC identifies and explores a number of challenges to the finance professional
        arising from the ever changing business environment. Increasingly, financial
        decisions must take account of strategic consequences. \n\nThe first module,
        Exploring Strategic Position, Choice and Action helps in doing that – setting
        a strategic context for planning for, monitoring and controlling projects
        and activities. An on-going set of challenges is found in the evolution of
        International Reporting Standards. \n\nThe second module focuses on some recent
        changes in Standards, identifying the drivers for changes, and examining evolution
        in controversial areas such as leasing and goodwill. \n\nThe third and final
        module, Corporate Governance, examines issues which are causing people to
        re-assess the nature, purpose and scope of corporate governance, and challenges
        to making governance function effectively. Key issues here are the move to
        include a broader range of stakeholders, the perennial challenge of agency
        theory issues, shareholder activism, changing Board structures, and challenges
        to internal control to better manage risk. \n\nThis MOOC will be right for
        you if you are interested in engaging with some of the challenges facing finance
        professionals, even if you are not one yourself. If you are thinking about
        returning to study this will provide a taster of academic endeavours through

        is philosophy?  How does it differ from science, religion, and other modes
        of human discourse?  This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western
        tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic
        natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are
        also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines
        made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus
        insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides
        of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later
        Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted
        to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the
        importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his
        pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical
        systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After
        the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed
        and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines
        of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part
        II will cover Aristotle and his successors.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/edd320a2a411e5a1f7d940fa69b157/raffael-aristotle.jpg","id":"gZ6cbKKkEeW1Bw7HN8tFsw","slug":"aristotle","name":"Ancient

        necesario plantear leyes que expliquen su comportamiento, como pueden ser
        las leyes de la gravedad, la propagación del calor, el electromagnetismo,
        la reproducción celular, el crecimiento poblacional, la propagación de las

        Para poder aplicar estas ecuaciones para resolver problemas, es necesario
        manipularlas  siguiendo ciertas reglas que nos da el álgebra.\n    Piensa
        en el álgebra como la gramática, que nos dice cómo traducir nuestras ideas

        and experiences about effective leadership and inspiring its development in
        others. The first iteration was during one of the other MOOCs in terms of
        the videos, readings, Forum chats and reflective exercises. The second iteration
        was doing one of the personal learning or action learning assignments in one
        of the MOOCs that involved talking to others and writing an essay about the

        course is designed to provide a basic understanding of financial statements

        financial statements, it is important to recognize that accounting is less
        about counting and more about measuring. “What is it that is being measured?”
        Well, as the course unfolds, you will learn about the three measurement questions
        and how the balance sheet helps to answer the first two of these questions.
        By touring a real company and interviewing real business people, the course
        describes the basic content of financial statements in a simple yet relevant
        context. The goal of the course is to leave a lasting impression about what
        balance sheet consists of and what it reveals. The next course in the Fundamentals
        of Accounting Specialization completes the conversation by addressing the
        remaining measurement question.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course,
        you will be able to:\n•\tDescribe the purpose of a balance sheet.\n•\tDefine
        the three components of a balance sheet.\n•\tRecognize and understand the
        meaning of several items typically presented on a balance sheet. \n•\tExplain

        beings, we cannot exist without communication. We need to interact with people
        around us, to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider
        social and cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication
        evolved as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course
        also extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring
        dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together
        with people all over the world.\n\nIntroduction to Communication Science explores
        some of the basic theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal
        and intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of
        several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of communication
        theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception approach and, finally,
        exploring theories on the production and reinforcement of culture through
        communication. \n\nUpon completion of this course, students should:\n•\thave
        knowledge of the history and development of communication science; \n•\thave
        knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science;
        \n•\thave knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts

        Experience design is design that is user centered. The goal is to design artifacts
        that allow the users to meet their needs in the most effective efficient and
        satisfying manner. The course introduces the novice to a cycle of discovery
        and evaluation and a set of techniques that meet the user''s needs.\n\nThis

        and data driven process.” Design is systematic because it is based on a set
        of techniques and also on a cycle of discovery.\n\nIn this course the learner
        is introduced to the four step user interface design cycle. Along the way
        learners are exposed to a set of techniques to gather information about a)
        what the user needs b)how to design and model interfaces based on these and
        then how to evaluate the design to ascertain that the user''s goals are met.
        These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give
        us the data we use in our design.\n\nThis means that anyone (regardless of
        their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow

        For five hundred years, the privilege of being able to publish was enjoyed
        by very few people – those who had access to a printing press or a radio microphone
        or a television camera. Now, almost anyone can publish to the world within

        curso\n\nLos procesos de globalización y europeización respaldan el rápido
        desarrollo de las ciudades en distintas partes del mundo. En el mundo contemporáneo,
        el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento
        de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles,
        Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más
        allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas
        grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como \"posmetrópolis\",
        \"ciudades globales\" y \"ciudades-regiones globales\". La clase estudiará
        debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así
        analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas
        ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué?
        ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más
        allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos
        en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias
        escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos
        lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes,
        sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación,
        y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación?
        ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados
        en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta
        qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación
        entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir
        a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? \nPor el momento, y considerando
        las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos,
        culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la
        concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción
        de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción,
        existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a
        veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos
        de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas,
        calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura
        física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias,
        representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética;
        los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno,
        movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de
        la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas
        y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico
        de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio,
        entre otros.\nLos asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas,
        gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido
        urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos,
        creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura
        urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.  \n\nTodos los vídeos realizados

        mindset as a specific state of mind which orientates human conduct towards
        entrepreneurial activities and outcomes. Individuals with entrepreneurial
        mindsets are often drawn to opportunities, innovation and new value creation.
        In terms outlined by Dr. Dweck this would be a specialized growth mindset
        as opposed to fixed mindset.\n\nHaving an entrepreneurial mindset is critical
        to being successful as an entrepreneur. An entrepreneurial mindset stands
        alone in terms of its importance. No other attribute, personality, inherent
        entrepreneurial proclivities, training, or demographic profile is common to
        all successful entrepreneurs whether Warren Buffet, Steve Jobs, or the neighborhood
        florist or grocer.\n\nThe course provides learners with an understanding of
        the attributes and perspectives of an entrepreneurial mindset, and the process
        to acquire one. The course introduces concepts that enables a person to start
        a transformative process in the way they think generally, and in the way they
        think about business specifically. This new way of thinking has the potential
        to positively impact not only them, but their family, and community.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/62/d167a0be5011e58696b71b3e2ddacb/thinking-resized.jpg","id":"JBCvTm03EeWEewoyD2Bc5Q","slug":"entrepreneurial-mindset","name":"Developing

        are increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability, responsibility
        and ethics. Managing responsibly is an integrative approach to sustainability,
        responsibility and ethics, which allows you as a manager to deal competently
        with such challenges. This course will facilitate your learning process to
        engage in changing practices to make them more sustainable, responsible, and
        ethically informed.\n\nWe will first introduce the context of the trend towards
        responsible management practices (week 1). We then explore the basics of each
        set of issues, sustainability (week 2), responsibility (week 3), and ethics
        (week 4). In week 5 you will work on your own responsible management issue/task
        and explore responsible management practices in an area of professional interest
        (e.g. strategy, entrepreneurship, innovation, organization, operations, supply
        chain, human resources, marketing and communication, international management,
        accounting and finance). In week 6 we will try to understand and experience
        what managing responsibly means in practice, including opportunities and challenges,
        and with a focus on transformative change. During these last two weeks you
        will work in a problem-oriented way, based on a challenging topic you have

        in collaboration with the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Management
        Education (PRME) initiative.\n\nOverall Learning Outcomes\n1) To provide an
        introduction to the three constituting fields of managing responsibly: sustainability,
        responsibility and ethics.\n2) To help apply the knowledge and insights gained
        from these three fields to real life problems in your own setting.\n3) To
        identify, understand and facilitate individual action that can lead to change
        at the organisational and system level ...to ‘act is to move’\n4) To learn
        to appreciate and bring together different points of view, and negotiate collective
        solutions to pressing problems.\n\nWho is this MOOC for? (Recommended Background)\nWhile
        this course is primarily designed for executives who want to work on particular

        expected to continue in the coming years, raising the urban population to
        6.0 billion by 2045. This dramatic increase in urban populations will inevitably
        increase the demand for energy, mobility (transportation), water, and other
        urban services in every city around the world. Without functional governance
        and management structures that ensure efficient, resilient and sustainable
        performance in cities, the current urbanization growth might become a catastrophic
        risk threatening the quality of life of the humanity.\n\nSustainable development
        in 21st century can only be realized by introducing innovations in both management
        and operations of urban infrastructures systems. Developing management practices
        that effectively integrates the processes of urban planning with urban infrastructures
        planning and management is a challenging goal that many cities are struggling
        with  nowadays, but is a must for transforming cities to sustainable and resilient

        В его основе этого курса лежат 64 опыта, в которых объясняются различные физические
        явления.\n\nЗачем изучать этот курс?\n• Физика – наука экспериментальная.
        Лучше один раз увидеть, чем сто раз услышать или прочитать! \n• Именно эксперименты
        позволяют продемонстрировать и легко понять и простые, и сложные аспекты,
        которые традиционно преподаются в виде теоретического материала и математических
        моделей\n• Курс поможет Вам научиться использовать: \n   o эксперимент как
        способ постановки вопроса, \n   o эксперимент как инструмент изучения физического
        явления\n   o эксперимент как  форму ответа на вопрос\n• Очень часто достаточно
        «простые» физические вопросы имеют неожиданные ответы, которые зависят от
        конкретных условий проведения эксперимента. Демонстрация таких опытов и объяснение
        полученных в них результатов могут оказаться чрезвычайно интересными\n• Вы
        сможете увидеть применение изучаемых физических явлений в жизни, в технике
        и в быту\n• Изучая этот курс, вы восполните нехватку времени на экспериментальную,
        «живую» физику, которая ощущается в обычном учебном процесс\n\nЧему учит этот
        курс?\n• Пониманию широкого круга как простых, так и сложных физических явлений
        и процессов по тематике соответствующих разделов\n• Применению физических
        закономерностей для анализа различных физических явлений и процессов \n• Навыкам  использования
        эксперимента\n• Базовым знаниям по физике будущих инженеров и специалистов
        в различных областях деятельности.\n\nДля кого этот курс?\n• Для тех, кто
        изучает физику, и хочет прояснить для себя различные вопросы (в школе, в вузе)\n•

        course is an introduction to the study of bodies in motion as applied to engineering
        systems and structures.  We will study the dynamics of particle motion and
        bodies in rigid planar (2D) motion.  This will consist of both the kinematics
        and kinetics of motion.  Kinematics deals with the geometrical aspects of
        motion describing position, velocity, and acceleration, all as a function
        of time.  Kinetics is the study of forces acting on these bodies and how it
        affects their motion.\n---------------------------\nRecommended Background:\n\nTo
        be successful in the course you will need to have mastered basic engineering
        mechanics concepts and to have successfully completed my courses en titled

        of the most diverse places on earth. \n\nIndia is an important player in the
        human story and is making a rapid return to centre stage. Learning about India
        has never been more relevant to our lives and possibly our careers.\n\nThis
        course, developed through a grant from the U.S. Department of State’s Passport
        to India initiative, is designed to introduce people of all backgrounds and
        ages to India and its potential as a destination for study, research, work
        and entrepreneurship. \n\nWhatever your interests, this course will help you
        develop a more informed perspective on the importance of India. The sheer
        diversity and scale of India are reasons enough for making India not just
        important but fascinating too.\n\nMany agree that two of the rising trends
        of the coming decades are the re-emergence of Asia and technological change.
        India is at the heart of both trends and shares much in common with the United
        States.\n\nAt the current pace of change, we may see:\n\n•\tWithin 10 years,
        India is likely to overtake China and have the world’s largest population\n•\tIn
        20 years, New Delhi overtaking Tokyo as the world’s largest city\n•\tIn 30
        years, India could overtake China and the US as the world’s largest economy\n\nBy
        the time a current college student is the same age as their parents are today

        still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome as you would read a
        book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA. In
        this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes
        from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms

        they can read shorter fragments of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph

        bacteria like MRSA are on the rise.  You know antibiotics as drugs, but on
        the molecular level they are short mini-proteins that have been engineered
        by bacteria to kill their enemies.  Determining the sequence of amino acids
        making up one of these antibiotics is an important research problem, and one
        that is similar to that of sequencing a genome by assembling tiny fragments

        Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has
        encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice
        and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers
        have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and
        philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions

        attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn’t
        exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these
        claims, radical as they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern

        un même objet, selon différents angles et de manière complémentaire. Il s''agit
        également de donner des repères permettant d''appréhender le dopage dans sa

        genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t
        just the sequence of your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are
        some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The
        answer is epigenetics.  \n\nEpigenetics has been a hot topic for research
        over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control
        contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are
        heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave
        similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic
        mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the
        potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent
        years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for
        example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis
        course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control.
        We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic
        control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the
        interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role
        of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will

        course is for activists, artists, and thinkers who wish to better understand
        and participate in social change. We will focus on the prolific and exciting
        overlap between socially engaged art and cultural practices generated by recent
        social movements around the world. Rather than assess the political efficacy
        of activities like mourning, listening, organizing, dancing, or partying,
        the lectures examine such cultural activities next to, and within, contemporary
        art practice. \n\nIncluded in the course are guest presentations by key artists,
        activists, and scholars, like: Rebecca Gomperts, Chido Govera, Gulf Labor,
        Hans Haacke, Sharon Hayes, Jolene Rickard, Gregory Sholette, Joshua Wong,
        and many more. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch and co-taught
        by Creative Time artistic director, Nato Thompson, the course challenges learners
        to treat the MOOC itself as a social and artistic form. This happens mostly
        through the practical components, local project productions, global exchanges,
        and critical feedback.\n\nWhile no prior art making or activist experience
        is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners.\n\nFor

        skriva fungerande texter? Det är en fråga som många studenter söker svar på.
        I denna kurs tar vi upp vad som är viktigt i det akademiska skrivandet. Du
        får konkreta tips på vad du kan tänka på för att utveckla både dina texter
        och ditt skrivande. Du får också träning genom olika övningar och kortare
        skrivuppgifter.\n\nMålet med kursen är att du ska kunna skriva akademiska
        texter i ditt ämne och också förstå hur du kan utvecklas som skribent.\n\nDet
        här är de mer specifika målen för varje kursmodul.\n\nEfter modul ett ska
        du  steg för steg kunna planera ditt skrivande och kunna använda respons som
        ett medel för att göra texterna bättre och utvecklas som skribent.\n\nEfter
        modul två ska du kunna anpassa en akademisk text till genre och ämnessammanhang
        samt utifrån genre och ämnessammanhang kunna välja innehåll, struktur och
        språkstil i din text.\n\nEfter modul tre ska du kunna framställa dig själv
        som skribent och dina argument på ett trovärdigt sätt samt kunna skriva en
        text med flyt och korrekt språk.\n\nEfter modul fyra ska du kunna referera
        och citera litteratur på ett akademiskt hederligt och korrekt sätt.\n\nI den
        femte modulen, som mer specifikt riktar sig till lärare, får du tips om hur
        du kan integrera och formulera mål för skrivande i din egen ämnesundervisning,
        hur du kan motivera studenter samt hur du kan effektivisera skrivträning och
        textrespons.\n\nObservera att alla uppgifter på den här kursen är frivilliga
        och du får inget intyg för att du har gjort dem. Men vi tror att de kommer
        att hjälpa dig att bli en bättre skribent så vi rekommenderar starkt att du
        gör så många uppgifter som möjligt. I så kallade “assignments” får du tillfälle
        att skriva en egen text utifrån instruktioner och kan därefter få den granskad
        av en annan kursdeltagare och du får också öva på att själv ge respons. Detta

        graphical models (PGMs) are a rich framework for encoding probability distributions
        over complex domains: joint (multivariate) distributions over large numbers

        at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts
        from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more. They
        are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications,

        the lens of three high-performing schools that each use a different type of
        blended learning.  A few of the key topics will include:\n\n- The role of
        the student and how to support students in the transition from traditional
        to blended learning\n- Implications for teachers in their day-to-day work
        and overall role\n- Impact on the way schools are designed including staffing
        models, use of time, hardware/software selection, and the use of data\n- Implementation
        challenges, potential solutions, and the remaining open questions\n\nWe will
        live by the attributes of blended learning in this course, encouraging students
        to take quizzes at the beginning of the module to assess their understanding

        to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this
        course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in
        a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your
        abstract thinking skills.   \n\nAfter finishing this course, you have learned
        to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption,
        and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix
        orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing,
        and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the
        special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will
        know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like
        throughput, latency and buffering.\n\nDisclaimer: As you will notice, there
        is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there
        are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this
        is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis
        skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would
        like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general
        and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you
        encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract
        thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in
        any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically,
        it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas
        with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving
        the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being
        used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive
        to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles
        of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow.
        So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.\n\nThis
        course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded
        Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital
        university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven),
        TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente). The course material is exactly the same as the

        our regular engagement with images does not necessarily make us visually literate.
        This course aims to address the gap between seeing and truly understanding
        photographs by introducing a diversity of ideas, approaches, and technologies
        that inform their making. In this course you will look closely at photographs
        from the collection of The Museum of Modern Art and hear a variety of perspectives
        on what a photograph is and the ways that photography has been used throughout
        its nearly 180 year history: as a means of artistic expression, as a tool
        for science and exploration; as an instrument of documentation; to tell stories
        and record histories; and as a mode of communication and critique in our ever
        increasingly visual culture.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n•\tDevelop skills
        to better examine and understand the differences between photographs and photographic
        images.\n•\tDiscover how context influences the production, circulation, and
        reception of photographic images.\n•\tLearn about different modes of artistic

        stories that have endured over a long time. Some of them have to do with events
        of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories
        of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of
        adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people
        who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these
        tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus
        on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature
        of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.
        We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves
        understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal
        truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are
        they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or
        are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over?
        This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics,
        including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and
        mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.\n***********************************************************************************************************\n                                                                           \nCOURSE
        SCHEDULE\n \n• Week 1: Introduction \nWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology!
        This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course
        itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic at hand: myth! How
        can we begin to define \"myth\"? How does myth work? What have ancient and
        modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth?
        This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with an eye to how
        we can best approach epic poetry.\nReadings: No texts this week, but it would
        be a good idea to get started on next week''s reading to get ahead of the
        game. \nVideo Lectures: 1.1-1.7 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the
        week.\n\n• Week 2: Becoming a Hero \nIn week 2, we begin our intensive study
        of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core text not only gives
        us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a
        kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical
        approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as he begins
        to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys homeward
        after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism, relationships
        between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values of hospitality
        and resourcefulness.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8 \nVideo Lectures:
        2.1-2.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 3: Adventures
        Out and Back \nThis week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations of Odysseus,
        \"man of twists and turns,\" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys abroad
        and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion of
        the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also follow
        Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives.
        Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from all of ancient
        myth.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16 \nVideo Lectures: 3.1-3.10 \nQuiz:
        Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 4: Identity and Signs
        \nAs he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on Ithaca and
        with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources to regain
        his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully begins
        to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants, his
        dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against those
        who have usurped his place.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24 \nVideo
        Lectures: 4.1-4.8 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n•
        Week 5: Gods and Humans \nWe will take a close look at the most authoritative
        story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony.
        Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony,
        or \"birth of the gods,\" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who
        were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents
        the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the
        universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.\nReadings: Hesiod,
        Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)* \nVideo Lectures:
        5.1-5.9 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 6: Ritual
        and Religion \nThis week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek
        religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect
        of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches
        us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of
        the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories
        about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they
        like us humans to perform.\nReadings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn
        to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn
        to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course) \nVideo
        Lectures: 6.1-6.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week
        7: Justice \nWhat counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one?
        Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think.
        This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all
        of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of
        tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return
        home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his
        wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to
        him. This family''s cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode,
        carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s
        immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.\nReadings:
        Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides \nVideo Lectures: 7.1-7.10 \nQuiz:
        Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 8: Unstable Selves\nThis
        week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on
        questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae.
        Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold
        by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what
        he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity
        after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before
        our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and
        unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae,
        the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god
        of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage.
        Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that
        can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.\nReadings: Sophocles,
        Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae \nVideo Lectures: 8.1-8.9\nQuiz: Complete
        the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade \nMoving
        ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean
        to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to
        rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His
        epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that
        both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In
        contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal
        about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making
        in action.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5 \nVideo Lectures: 9.1-9.10
        \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 10: Roman Myth
        and Ovid''s Metamorphoses \nOur consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with
        his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman
        poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound,
        witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient
        myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through
        the lens of the Romans and others who \"remythologize,\" we wrap up the course
        with a retrospective look at myth.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid,
        Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13. \nVideo Lectures: 10.1-10.9.\nQuiz: Complete
        the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n***********************************************************************************************************\nREADINGS\nThere
        are no required texts for the course, however, Professor Struck will make
        reference to the following texts in the lecture:\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume
        1, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, trans. (Chicago)\n• Greek Tragedies,

        plays an important role in our daily lives and is woven into the fabric of
        society. We listen to music while alone or in company, in a dance club or
        at home, through simple headphones or via high-end speakers, as background
        or as foreground, after we get up or before we go to bed. Music accompanies
        us when we are traveling, doing sports, shopping, working or relaxing. This
        omnipresence of music raises several questions: how does music affect our
        lives? What is the relation between the society we live in and the role, function,
        and position of music within that society? How is music influenced by and
        does music influence social, political, economic, technological, and multiple
        other developments? \n\nDo these questions trigger you? Music and Society
        provides a thorough introduction to the various ways in which music and society
        are connected through engaging lectures, insightful interviews, challenging
        assignments, interesting readings, and of course a lot of musical examples.
        The course aims at increasing your insights on where, how and why we listen

        people know that electrically active cells in nerves, in the heart and in

        the course “Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communications\":
        we will:\n\n1)\tBuild skills in the analysis of the intercultural communication
        process using Russian-Western communication as an example.  \n2)\tApply the
        knowledge of interrelations between different contexts of communication (cultural,
        institutional, professional, social, interpersonal, etc.) to the cultural
        history and national psychology of Russians.\n\nThe purpose of the course
        is to provide the students with a broad overview of the basic principles governing
        the past, the present and the future interactions between Russia and the West,
        with a focus on the culture and national psychology of Russians and Western
        Europeans.\n\nFor example, we will look at the cases when basic cultural values
        of Russians show up through the linguistic choices shaping language production
        which is consequently misattributed by Western partners. No matter what the
        language of intercultural communication is – Russian, or English – the meaning
        of many linguistic expressions may be reconstructed wrongly by the representatives
        of another culture.\n\nSome of the basic questions we will tackle are:\n\n•\tWhat
        are the concepts of culture that have the strongest influence on communication?\n•\tWhat
        are Russian basic cultural values and how they shape modern Russian consciousness?\n•\tWhat
        are the specific communication patterns of modern Russians, including those
        of public and electronic discourse?\n•\tWhat is important to know about communication
        with Russians in organizational contexts?\n\nImportantly, this course is NOT
        just a list of practical instructions of dos and don’ts of dealing with Russians.
        The course contains a substantial academic component introducing the key notions
        and concepts of the Theory of Communication, which will be extensively introduced
        throughout the first few modules of the course. These theoretical grounds
        will be further on used as a tool for analyzing the intercultural communications

        path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial
        ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world
        do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other
        models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs
        do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials,
        donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to
        support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is
        Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course,
        we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. \n\nA massive intervention
        of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for
        over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including
        job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing
        startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but
        whether or not they''ve hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined.
        A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop.
        Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success
        with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship
        challenging. \n\nDuring this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have
        launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights
        to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources
        made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations.
        We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process
        of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still
        to be determined. \n\nIn addition to learning about Cleveland''s attempts
        to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from
        leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia,
        Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth
        of start-up companies.\n\nOne of our goals is to learn from you how different
        communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods
        to support businesses. Taking what we''ve learned from our examples in class,
        I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live.
        I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information
        flows in multiple directions. \n\nMost MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures,
        but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front
        of the camera, talking and lecturing every module. Instead, the lectures will
        be relatively short in length and will have more of the feel of an engaging
        documentary than a static classroom setting.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/02/6833219a4722f01632407f5265c508/Beyond-Silcon-Valley-Logo.jpg","name":"Beyond

        processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts
        to use when taking a solo.\n\nWhile many people are fans of jazz and understand
        that musicians are often “making up” the notes they are playing during a performance,
        most people—often including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn
        improvising—aren’t clear about what exact processes take place to enable this
        to happen. The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of
        modern improvisation and how to go about mastering the different musical and
        mental skills involved. \n\nCourse author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after
        approach to improvisation that has been at the core of Berklee College of
        Music''s curriculum for decades. Students who complete this course will know
        what to practice and how to practice the various aspects of improvising, in
        addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously communicates to
        the listeners through their musical creations.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/de/4a93f07cc111e5b6970bf60813874a/jazz-large.jpg","id":"ypgDPuPQEeSyBSIAC9REKg","slug":"jazz-improvisation","name":"Jazz

        you’ll achieve: \n\nIn this project-centered course*, you will design a series
        bible and write a complete pilot episode for your own unique television or
        web series, be it drama or comedy or something in between. You’ll learn to
        break down the creative process into components, and you’ll discover a structured
        process that allows you to produce a polished and pitch-ready script in just
        a few weeks. Completing this project will increase your confidence in your
        ideas and abilities, and you’ll feel prepared to pitch your first script and
        get started on your next. \n\nThis is a course designed to tap into your creativity
        and is based in \"Active Learning\". Most of the actual learning takes place
        within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\n\"Thank
        you so much for your direct way of teaching this course. It was encouraging
        for us all to creatively flow and find our own voice in writing and developing
        our scripts. This aspect was very important to me.\" Ingrid\n\nThe course
        curriculum is simple: you’ll write, revise your work, and share feedback with
        your peers. \n\nI am a proponent of Experiential Learning (active learning).
        My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point,
        designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer.
        I will guide you but I won’t \"show\" you how to write. I firmly believe that
        the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.\n\n“David''s lecture
        style for this course is inspired. The videos are succinct and engaging. When
        I watch the lectures I feel David’s sincere desire for me to create something
        truly amazing. He is teaching us how to write a script, and he is providing
        wisdom and tools that will help us do so in a compelling way - by writing;
        not by watching him talk at us.” - A R Adamson\n\nWhat you’ll need to get
        started:\n\nTo begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two,
        you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx
        or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, or you can continue to
        use your word processor and do your own script formatting.\n\nLearner Review:
        \"I am in love with this course. Having never written a script before, or
        any substantive fiction since college (15 years ago) I had a small idea in
        my head that has now exploded into something I really believe in. David''s
        guidance is spot on, he''s his own compelling story teller, he gives you enough,

        suitability for a brief online introductory course, on the other. The course
        content is neither comprehensive (which would be a \"mission impossible\"
        for virtually any public economics course\"), nor representative of other
        such courses. With these limitations and caveats in mind, we encourage our
        students to continue their public economics studies in a more regular fashion,
        and see our role inter alia in motivating interest in such \"continued education\".\n\nThe
        central theme of the course is the role of government as a mechanism of resource
        allocation which complements and augments markets. Governments are viewed
        as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are
        prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two
        imperfect alternatives. We deal with government''s limitations, with particular
        emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative
        capacity, and imperfect accountability to society. Otherwise the course''s
        man themes are economics of taxation, regulation, politics of public economics,
        incentives in government, and government vis-à-vis (civil) society.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/80/39a038465fe5a012e7a6f0a9dcbb50/Public-Economics.jpg","id":"0GYQX5MEEeWBAQoVMoNgNQ","slug":"public-economics","name":"Public

        and apply Business Statistics are becoming increasingly important in the industry.
        A good understanding of Business Statistics is a requirement to make correct
        and relevant interpretations of data. Lack of knowledge could lead to erroneous
        decisions which could potentially have negative consequences for a firm. This
        course is designed to introduce you to Business Statistics. We begin with
        the notion of descriptive statistics, which is summarizing data using a few
        numbers. Different categories of descriptive measures are introduced and discussed
        along with the Excel functions to calculate them. The notion of probability
        or uncertainty is introduced along with the concept of a sample and population
        data using relevant business examples. This leads us to various statistical
        distributions along with their Excel functions which are then used to model
        or approximate business processes. You get to apply these descriptive measures
        of data and various statistical distributions using easy-to-follow Excel based
        examples which are demonstrated throughout the course.\n\nTo successfully
        complete course assignments, students must have access to Microsoft Excel.
        \n________________________________________\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Basic Data Descriptors\nIn
        this module you will get to understand, calculate and interpret various descriptive
        or summary measures of data. These descriptive measures summarize and present
        data using a few numbers. Appropriate Excel functions to do these calculations
        are introduced and demonstrated.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tCategories
        of descriptive data\n•\tMeasures of central tendency, the mean, median, mode,
        and their interpretations and calculations\n•\tMeasures of spread-in-data,
        the range, interquartile-range, standard deviation and variance\n•\tBox plots\n•\tInterpreting
        the standard deviation measure using the rule-of-thumb and Chebyshev’s theorem\n________________________________________\nWEEK
        2\nModule 2: Descriptive Measures of Association, Probability, and Statistical
        Distributions\nThis module presents the covariance and correlation measures
        and their respective Excel functions. You get to understand the notion of
        causation versus correlation. The module then introduces the notion of probability
        and random variables and starts introducing statistical distributions.\n\nTopics
        covered include:\n•\tMeasures of association, the covariance and correlation
        measures; causation versus correlation\n•\tProbability and random variables;
        discrete versus continuous data\n•\tIntroduction to statistical distributions\n________________________________________\nWEEK
        3\nModule 3: The Normal Distribution\nThis module introduces the Normal distribution
        and the Excel function to calculate probabilities and various outcomes from
        the distribution. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tProbability density function
        and area under the curve as a measure of probability\n•\tThe Normal distribution
        (bell curve), NORM.DIST, NORM.INV functions in Excel\n________________________________________\nWEEK
        4\nModule 4: Working with Distributions, Normal, Binomial, Poisson\nIn this
        module, you''ll see various applications of the Normal distribution. You will
        also get introduced to the Binomial and Poisson distributions. The Central
        Limit Theorem is introduced and explained in the context of understanding
        sample data versus population data and the link between the two.\n\nTopics
        covered include:\n•\tVarious applications of the Normal distribution\n•\tThe
        Binomial and Poisson distributions\n•\tSample versus population data; the

        i.e., those middle- and low-income countries, which have conducted market-oriented
        economic reforms and become integrated into the global economy since 1990s.
        \n\nIt starts from a brief history of communist economic system based on central
        planning in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, its evolution
        and collapse at the end of 1980s/ early 1990s and subsequent transition to
        a market system in 1990s and 2000s. Then it analyzes experience of market
        reforms in China, India, other Asian countries, Middle East and North Africa,
        Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America at the same period. Finally, it discusses
        the problems of contemporary global economy and global and regional economic
        governance with the special focus given to emerging-market economies and their
        role.\nBy the end of the course you will be able to analyse emerging-market
        economies and economies in transition, taking into account their crucial characteristics

        a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This
        morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh
        fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school.
        At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor.
        During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone.
        So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all
        of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products
        can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one
        of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider
        fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast
        table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people
        involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries.
        Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are
        connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries
        themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow
        back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we
        have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier,
        manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially
        a value chain. \n\nFor the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize
        value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order
        to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant
        in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of
        the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure
        value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products
        and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers,
        haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it! \n\nIn this
        course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for
        the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product
        or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated,
        who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As
        our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective,
        which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather
        than short-term symptomatic problem solving.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/e4d760326a11e4b11777b7665ca86d/scm-logo.jpg","name":"Supply

        storytelling is the practice of designing, sharing, and participating in a
        cohesive story experience across multiple traditional and digital delivery
        platforms - for entertainment, advertising and marketing, or social change.
        \n\nHave you ever read a book, seen a movie, watched a television show, or
        played a game that centred around different aspects of a larger story or universe?
        You may be familiar with popular examples of such universes like Star Wars,
        Marvel, and The Walking Dead (to name a few). \n\nHow do the professionals
        develop such expansive narratives? How do they ensure that each element stays
        true to the original story? How do they innovatively use different technologies
        to share the stories, grow audiences and create an active and involved community
        of fans? \n\nMore and more, we are also engaging with elements or franchises
        of larger and more complex stories across a much more diverse range of platforms
        like interactive web experiences, social media communities, mobile devices,
        theme parks, and even augmented and virtual reality. A major challenge that
        current and future storytellers face is being able to engage different audiences
        in a story that is seamlessly told across all of these different platforms.\n\n\nWHAT
        WILL I LEARN?\nThis course  will help you to design a strategy for developing
        and telling your own transmedia story. You will learn about what it takes
        to:\n• Shape your ideas into compelling and well structured narratives and
        complex story worlds\n• Identify, understand, and engage different audiences
        in your stories\n• Create cohesive user experiences across different platforms\n•
        Evaluate existing and emerging technologies to share your story with the world,
        and help your audience participate in the larger storyworld you create\n\nThe
        course provides you with a unique, authentic, and industry relevant learning
        opportunity. You will have access to current theory, industry examples and
        advice and undertake learning activities that will equip you with the tools
        you need to start developing your own ideas.\n\n\nWHO WILL MY INSTRUCTORS
        BE?\nYou will learn effective transmedia design strategies from leading UNSW
        Australia Art & Design academics. You will also examine case studies that
        demonstrate how amazing ideas, technology and audience contributions can be
        brought together to create dynamic storyworlds. You''ll see examples of major,
        successful transmedia storytelling projects involving movies, digital entertainment,
        gaming, virtual reality and more. In collaboration with our industry partner

        in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national
        borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers
        or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team,
        or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member
        of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with
        an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts,
        your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are
        able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context.
        \n\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi
        alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural
        leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed
        systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling
        us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience,
        sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management
        scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision
        making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and
        use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international
        leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership
        competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning
        about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your
        leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do
        you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try
        motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse
        skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with
        a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances
        from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave
        and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this
        is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting
        you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1
        - Leadership Acumen. International perspective on leadership, common traps
        & challenges, and opportunities of intercultural leadership. \nWeek 2 - Navigating
        Culture. Impact of cultural differences on organizations, decoding culture,
        culture classifications and stereotyping, developing intercultural intelligence.

        this introductory, self-paced course, you will learn multiple theories of
        organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.\n\nOrganizations
        are groups whose members coordinate their behaviors in order to accomplish
        a shared goal. They can be found nearly everywhere in today’s society: universities,
        start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations,
        restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many
        examples of organizations.\n\nOrganizations are as varied and complex as they
        are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail
        a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!);
        they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from
        those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal
        with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity
        frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants
        and the organization’s survival.\n\nIn this course, we will use organizational
        theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best
        be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization’s
        structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production,
        and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations
        and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized.
        Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational
        problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules
        of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able
        to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events
        transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed
        mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best
        redirect the organization in desired directions.\n\nIn sum, the course has
        three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational
        phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate
        these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of “seeing” and managing
        organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively
        bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools
        and ways to negotiate novel situations.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/organalysis/large-icon.png","id":"T4_v6hfTEeaUCRJWL-pjpQ","slug":"organizational-analysis","name":"Organizational

        nouvelles technologies de l’information ont facilité l’accès à de nombreuses

        suivi ce mouvement en modernisant l’ensemble des supports, des plans, des
        cartes topographiques et de tous les types de données à référence spatiale.
        Face au déploiement massif des cartes numériques et des nombreux services

        help you be a better negotiator. Unlike many negotiation courses, we develop

        see beneath the surface of apparent conflicts to uncover the underlying interests.
        You will leave the course better able to predict, interpret, and shape the
        behavior of those you face in competitive situations.\n\nIn this course, you
        will have several opportunities to negotiate with other students using case
        studies based on common situations in business and in life. You can get feedback
        on your performance and compare what you did to how others approached the
        same scenario. The cases also provide a setting to discuss a wide-ranging
        set of topics including preparing for a negotiation, making ultimatums, avoiding
        regret, expanding the pie, and dealing with someone who has a very different
        perspective on the world. Advanced topics include negotiating when you have
        no power, negotiating over email, and the role of gender differences in negotiation.

        what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Tunis to Tehran, what political
        positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming
        obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished
        to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.\n\nSince 2009
        there has been a renewed wave of popular unrest sweeping throughout much of
        the Muslim world. Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies
        have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various
        Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal
        unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing
        constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.\nThis
        course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have
        developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries,
        but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and
        shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings
        on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary
        debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th
        and 21st centuries.\n\nThree common themes will characterise the course: \n\nWe
        privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight
        where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. \n\nWe
        seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative
        capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception
        of modern bureaucratic statehood. \n\nWe seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction
        with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for
        greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. \n\nUltimately,
        the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary
        discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious
        law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical
        feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular
        model of governance.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a1/06feb0912011e6b56555959fea98b6/constitutionalstruggles_175x175.jpg","name":"Constitutional

        a network of connected things and making devices internet enabled. We will
        discuss rules, protocols, and standards for these devices to communicate with
        each other in the network. We will also go through security and privacy issues
        and challenges in cyber physical systems (CPS). We will explore measures and
        techniques for securing systems from different perspectives. Possible attack
        models are introduced and solutions to tackle such attacks are discussed.
        Moreover, some basic concepts related to privacy in cyber physical systems
        are presented.\n\nThe course comprises altogether five modules and is split
        up into two main sections. The first section contains three modules and centers
        on the problem of web connectivity in cyber physical systems. The second section
        consist of two modules focusing on security measures in such systems. Each
        module ends with a graded quiz, and there is a final peer reviewed exam at
        the end of the course covering the two main sections of the course. \n\nAfter
        completing this course, you will have the basic knowledge and capacity for
        designing the network architecture of your cyber physical system. This includes
        putting together different components, selecting suitable communication protocols,
        and utilizing these protocols in your system. You will also be able to define
        security requirements for your system and choose and implement a proper security
        and privacy technique to protect it.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/06/b00ca08bd311e6b3648b3f195ea009/iStock_71759029_XLARGE.jpg","id":"Ta6IMur8EeWeThJDJYT0Zw","slug":"iot-connectivity-security","name":"Web

        hire people who believe in their organization, its mission and the work that’s
        involved in the job position. Every hiring manager knows: Hire people to do
        a job and they’ll work for your money. Hire people who believe in the work
        and they’ll work for their passion.\n\nAnd this is not a case of “fake it
        until you make it.” You have to be genuine about your belief in an organization
        and its mission. That means you have to have researched the industry, the
        company, and the position – and be able to show how your goals in life align
        with the company’s mission. Having done so will shape the impression you convey
        as a candidate, the way you answer traditional questions, and the way you
        demonstrate that you’re the right candidate for the job.\n\nThis course is
        the second in a five-course specialization. We recommend that courses #1,
        #2 and #3 be taken in sequence. Course #4 - on resume and cover letter writing

        course #3 is \"Interviewing II.\"  Course #3 covers more advanced interview

        special case of telephone screenings.  The logic for including telephone screenings
        - which happen at the start of the interview process - late in this specialization
        on interviewing is that those screenings, while happening early in the process,
        involve all the skills that you''ll learn from course #1 through course #3.\n\nAs
        for this course, it will teach you how to:\n\n1.\tDo thorough research on

        and calculus will help you be successful in this class.\n-What will this class
        prepare me for in the academic world? \n     Thermodynamics is a prerequisite
        for many follow-on courses, like heat transfer, internal combustion engines,
        propulsion, and gas dynamics, to name a few.\n-What will this class prepare
        me for in the real world? \n     Energy is one of the top challenges we face
        as a global society. Energy demands are deeply tied to the other major challenges
        of clean water, health, food resources, and poverty. Understanding how energy
        systems work is key to understanding how to meet all these needs around the
        world. Because energy demands are only increasing, this course also provides
        the foundation for many rewarding professional careers.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/ab6f50003c2033b621b52827259308/bigstockphoto_Gas_Energy_Flames_209173_EDIT.jpg","id":"zFT002OEEeS5wCIAC4UKdg","slug":"thermodynamics-intro","name":"Introduction

        You should complete all the other courses in this Specialization before beginning
        this course.\n\nThis six-week long Project course of the Data Mining Specialization
        will allow you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining
        from the previous courses in the Specialization, including Pattern Discovery,
        Clustering, Text Retrieval, Text Mining, and Visualization, to solve interesting
        real-world data mining challenges. Specifically, you will work on a restaurant
        review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned
        from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and
        useful knowledge. The design of the Project emphasizes: 1) simulating the
        workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining
        techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different
        ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4)
        allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. \n\nThe goal
        of the Project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover
        useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will
        include the following outputs: \n\n1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize
        the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.\n2.
        Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of
        different types of cuisines and their similarities.\n3. Discovery of popular
        dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes
        of a particular cuisine.\n4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people
        decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific
        dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.\n\nFrom the perspective
        of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and
        see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they
        decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular
        dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will
        need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular
        dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant
        would also be helpful. \n\nBy working on these tasks, you will gain experience
        with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data
        exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation
        of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from
        different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment
        with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve
        it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to
        explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the
        Project. \n\nYou are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks
        for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required, which will
        be peer-graded.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/de/4dbe30ff5811e58319afc42ddc386b/DataMiningCapstone_logo-_1_.png","id":"TISsePHrEeWDTRLZKqoZew","slug":"data-mining-project","name":"Data

        that are used in Android, which is the dominant platform for developing and
        deploying mobile device apps. \n\nIn particular, this MOOC covers key Java
        programming language features that control the flow of execution through an
        app (such as Java’s various looping constructs and conditional statements),
        enable access to structured data (such as Java''s built-in arrays and common
        classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList and HashMap),
        group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Java''s
        primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and
        exceptions), customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and
        polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners
        will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such
        as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android
        Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.  \n\nLearners
        will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week
        will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce
        the material covered in the lecture videos. There will be roughly 4-6 hours

        emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues,
        and country and western--styles that previously had remained relatively separate.
        This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often
        associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy
        first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came

        of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you’ve been playing
        for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds around them. We’ll explore
        definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking

        es una palabra que se usa para muchas cosas diferentes y a veces opuestas.
        Cuando la gente intenta concertar una definición, hay una tendencia general
        a recurrir al modelo heroico del liderazgo, de un hombre con características
        especiales y en un puesto directivo que convence a otros de seguirlo hacia
        su visión. Este modelo es atractivo, pero limitado y obsoleto para la mayoría
        de los desafíos que nos importan hoy en día. El “modelo heroico” suele ser
        muy útil para solucionar problemas que no requieren cambios en las personas
        involucradas en solucionarlos, pero es menos útil o incluso factible para
        progresar en la solución de problemas difíciles de definir, en situaciones
        en que hay mucha incertidumbre, y cuando parte importante del problema son
        las decisiones hábitos y miedos de la propia gente (tú incluida/o) que necesita
        trabajar para llegar a la solución.\n \nEn este curso vamos a preguntarnos
        ¿qué concepción de liderazgo y qué tipo de habilidades son útiles para el
        complejo y cambiante mundo en el que vivimos?, ¿cómo se aprenden estas habilidades?,
        ¿para qué tipo de desafíos es necesario el liderazgo?, ¿qué recursos de poder
        y formas de autoridad hacen parte del liderazgo y cuáles no?, ¿qué riesgos
        tiene la práctica del liderazgo?, ¿cómo te proteges?.\n \nVamos a invitarte
        a que, en el espacio virtual y en tu vida real, adquieras una perspectiva
        potente, unas “Gafas Efectivas” para mirar el mundo complejo en el que vives,
        diagnosticar los desafíos que te importan y planear intervenciones para avanzar
        en ellos. En otras palabras, el curso te acompaña en el proceso de adueñarte
        de una metodología de diagnóstico e intervención, que llamamos Espiral de
        Liderazgo Consciente, que te va ayudar a identificar y caracterizar:\n\n1.
        tus propósitos\n2. los desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentas para llegar
        a ellos\n3. los aspectos técnicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades, que tienen
        que ver con reglas, dinero, conocimiento, expertos y autoridades formales\n4.
        los aspectos humanos y sistémicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades: que tienen
        que ver con las personas interesadas y afectadas, sus valores, miedos, las
        facciones que forman y a veces pelean entre sí, la probabilidad de que sean
        aliados o detractores\n5. tus recursos formales e informales (y desafíos internos)
        que afectan el tema que quieres avanzar, y los riesgos del liderazgo que probablemente
        enfrentarás\n\nTodo ello para que planees intervenciones y experimentos de
        avance, y reflexiones sobre cómo protegerte (pensando en el sistema, haciendo
        alianzas, reflexionando en la acción, escuchando a las facciones, gestionando
        tus emociones, etc)\n \nVamos a invitarte también a observar y profundizar
        tu habilidad para estar presente y para reflexionar y aprender antes, durante
        y después de hacer alguna intervención dirigida a mejorar tus resultados personales
        o de grupo. En otras palabras, vamos a acompañarte a profundizar en tres herramientas
        que llamamos “Estoy Aquí”;  “Subir al Balcón” y “Parada para respirar” que
        tienen que ver con meta-observar al mundo, a ti mismo en el mundo y a tu mundo
        interior y encontrar la respuesta a preguntas como: ¿cómo te sientes cuando
        estás intensamente presente en una actividad (o en un sistema en el que quieres
        intervenir para cambiar los resultados)?, ¿cuáles son los mecanismos por los
        que se dispersa tu atención y las justificaciones que te das a ti mismo para
        dejar de estar presente?, ¿qué está pasando en el mundo externo?, ¿qué está
        pasando en tu interior?.\n \nEstos objetivos de aprendizaje implican que el
        curso al que vas a entrar no está diseñado de forma convencional, como clases
        magistrales en las que un experto te “enseña” conceptos, sino que el rol de
        los profesores en este curso es el de diseñar oportunidades de aprendizaje
        para ti, y acompañarte a que reflexiones sobre ellas.\n \n\"Estilos de Liderazgo:
        Opciones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos\" es el primero de cuatro cursos
        que componen el programa especializado en \"Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo
        XXI\". Los otros tres cursos son: \"Autoliderazgo y Gestión de Emociones para
        Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos\"; \"Comunicación, Experimentación y Aprendizaje
        en Liderazgo\"; y \"Liderazgo para el siglo XXI: Proyecto Final\". \n\nEn
        general, todo el programa está dirigido a cualquier persona interesada en
        conectarse con sus propósitos y profundizar sus habilidades para progresar
        en desafíos personales y colectivos muy complejos. Es especialmente útil para
        personas en mandos medios y altos en organizaciones públicas, privadas y no
        gubernamentales (ONGs). También para líderes comunitarios, activistas y en
        general gente que trabaja con personas y que necesita desarrollar o profundizar
        habilidades y herramientas para crear, a partir de grupos con opiniones e
        intereses diversos comunidades que trabajan juntas para avanzar en los temas
        que les importan. Va a ser útil, también, para personas interesadas en aprender
        a mejorar los resultados que observan en su esfera de vida más personal.\n\nPara

        course ''Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark
        side of the force'' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push
        good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect
        yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.\n\nAbout
        the Course\n\nThis course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can
        push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves
        and their organization against ethical blindness.\n\nThe goal of this course
        is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal
        behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various
        disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature,
        in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding
        of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent
        organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these
        disciplines.\n\nWhenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe
        that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character
        deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that
        bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have
        demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the
        rules if they are put into a strong context.\n\nA better understanding of
        why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will
        enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations
        against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable
        us to cure societies from problems like corruption.\n\nAt the end of the course,
        you are able to:\n\n1.    Explain the impact of social context on individual
        decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology,
        and Philosophy) \n2.    Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the
        most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades \n3.    Assess
        risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context \n4.    Design
        interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization \n\n\nRecommended
        Background\n\nNo background expertise is required. The course is open for
        interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it
        as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).\n\nWhy
        is this course important for me? \n\nCurrently, the understanding of why good
        people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather
        fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly
        simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including
        the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the
        healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance.
        In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool
        box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your
        life!\n\nWhat do I need to follow this course? \n\nWe build bridges between
        various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines
        smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences
        about unethical decisions. After all, we are all experts in making decisions—some
        more ethically, some less ethically—aren’t we?","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ff/079482ccced35e86a8a9ea70e0c0e4/Biz_ethics_Fotolia_49499572.png","id":"A9Yb1uFoEeWLHw5Kc9wFbw","slug":"unethical-decision-making","name":"Unethical

        A and B first -- Part C \"dives right in\" and refers often to material from
        Part A and Part B.]\n\nThis course is an introduction to the basic concepts
        of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming.
        The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching
        the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language
        “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language --
        and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical
        nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding
        how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant
        programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply
        than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional
        programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable,
        and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages
        have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and
        beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe
        course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more
        detail in the first module of Part A.  Part B assumes successful completion
        of Part A.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part
        B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A,
        the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the
        three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for
        a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in
        order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  \n\nWeek
        1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the

        have to keep in mind all of these and design an appropriate investment plan
        for each stage of his life. You will use the concepts learned in the 4 courses
        to achieve this target. You should consider different assets and different
        markets to achieve the investors goals by building an optimal portfolio which

        is this course for?  \nThis course is designed for students, business analysts,
        and data scientists who want to apply statistical knowledge and techniques
        to business contexts. For example, it may be suited to experienced statisticians,
        analysts, engineers who want to move more into a business role, in particular
        in marketing.\n\nYou will find this course exciting and rewarding if you already
        have a background in statistics, can use R or another programming language
        and are familiar with databases and data analysis techniques such as regression,
        classification, and clustering.\nHowever, it contains a number of recitals
        and R Studio tutorials which will consolidate your competences, enable you
        to play more freely with data and explore new features and statistical functions
        in R.\n\nBusiness Analytics, Big Data and Data Science are very hot topics
        today, and for good reasons. Companies are sitting on a treasure trove of
        data, but usually lack the skills and people to analyze and exploit that data
        efficiently. Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people
        to analyze and exploit that data will have a clear competitive advantage.\n\nIt''s
        especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected
        by companies today are related to customer actions and marketing activities.The
        domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge, and may cover fancy topics
        such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time
        bidding, online campaign optimization, and so on.\n\nBut at the heart of marketing
        lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered: (1) who are my customers,
        (2) which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget
        on, and (3) what''s the future value of my customers so I can concentrate
        on those who will be worth the most to the company in the future.\n\nThat''s
        exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding
        your customers, scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer
        lifetime value is about anticipating their future value. These are the foundations
        of Marketing Analytics. And that''s what you''ll learn to do in this course.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/9b71704d6d11e5985513dbe77c0d84/foundation-of-marketing-redi-8.png","id":"1e3cxzeNEeWO-Qq6rEZAow","slug":"foundations-marketing-analytics","name":"Foundations

        governments deserve our allegiance, and when should they be denied it? \n\nThis
        course explores the main answers that have been given to this question in
        the modern West. We start with a survey of the major political theories of
        the Enlightenment: Utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract tradition.
        In each case we begin with a look of classical formulations, locating them
        in historical context, but then shift to the contemporary debates as they
        relate to politics today.\n\nNext we turn to the rejection of Enlightenment
        political thinking, again exploring both classical and contemporary formulations.
        The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for,
        democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment
        political thinking.\n\nIn addition to exploring theoretical differences among
        the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical
        implications of their competing arguments. To this end, we discuss a variety
        of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative
        action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the
        regulation of speech and religion, and difficulties raised by the emerging

        natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are
        also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines
        made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus
        insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides
        of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later
        Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted
        to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the
        importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his
        pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical
        systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After
        the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed
        and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines
        of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part

        integration has become contested.  People have become more critical of European
        policy and often seem to prefer local policy solutions in response to globalization
        problems.  This becomes clear from the rise of Eurosceptic parties in many
        EU member states and it is also reflected in the results of several referendums.  Earlier
        this year voters in the Netherlands said ‘no’ to the Association agreement
        with the Ukraine.  In the UK, voters supported leaving the EU with a small
        margin.  These developments make it important to clarify whether and how European
        policy is beneficial to you.  So, how do you experience EU policy? Does it
        provide you with benefits? And if not, how can we change this? \n\nWe will
        talk with experts from all over Europe to get insights from behind the scenes.
        You will learn how policy is transferred to member states, and we will discuss
        the challenges of this multi-level structure and focus on the main causes
        of policy failure or success.  On this journey we will encounter actual policy:
        how easy is it to establish yourself in another EU-country? How do governments
        make sure that the air you breathe is clean? And who is responsible?  \n\nIn
        this course we work with leading cases that will help you put your knowledge
        into practice.  You will also do research together in your own local setting.
        Research on implementation in which you can make comparisons between different
        countries or areas. If you live outside the EU, this is not a problem. We
        have developed assignments in such a way that you can do research in your
        area and compare your findings with others. This unique feature makes it possible
        to compare implementation in Beijing, São Paulo or Cairo with Rome, Paris
        or Berlin. \n\nSo are you curious to find out what Europe can do for you?

        can we use computers to create expressive, compelling music? And how can we
        write computer software to help us create and organize sounds in new ways?
        This course provides a hands-on introduction to the field of music technology
        as both a creative musical practice and an interdisciplinary technical research
        pursuit. Students will be able to compose music in digital audio workstation
        software using both audio and symbolic representations; to write code to algorithmically
        generate music, analyze sound, and design sound; and to describe the essential
        theory and history behind these activities as well as their connection to
        cutting-edge computer music research. Through the exploration of topics such
        as acoustics, psychoacoustics, digital sound, digital signal processing, audio
        synthesis, spectral analysis, algorithmic composition, and music information
        retrieval, we will explore the deep relationships between art and science,
        between theory and practice, and between experimental and popular electronic
        music.\n\nWe will learn about these topics in the context of digital audio
        workstation (DAW) software, the multi-track editing paradigm that has been
        dominant in music production since the 1980s. As we learn about the foundations
        behind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create
        music with it, and we will also write a series of short software programs

        española y argentina o americana del Español estudiadas en textos cultos de
        referencia? En este curso se estudian empíricamente algunos aspectos relevantes
        de esas variedades de la lengua con datos significativos de las versiones
        hispanas de J. D. Salinger: «El cazador oculto», argentinas; y «El guardián
        entre el centeno», españolas.\nLas Encuestas de Evaluación de la edición anterior
        (http://bit.ly/1QYPAJI) permiten hacerse una idea cabal de las consideraciones
        que ha merecido el curso.\n\nEn este curso, con una consideración policéntrica
        de la lengua, se pretende activar o potenciar el interés por la corrección
        de los textos propios y ajenos; por las diferencias de estilo en dos versiones

        finalidad del curso es doble. \nAnte un texto ajeno suscitar el interés sobre
        lo que se dice; y sobre cómo se diría mejor: con más claridad, con más precisión,
        con más propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de mayor calidad argumentada lingüísticamente.
        \nY, ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor
        lo que se pretende: con más claridad, de manera unívoca; con más precisión;
        con gusto más general y sancionado; con ‘estilo’ de mejor consideración. \n\nFinalizar
        este curso le permitirá: \n1. Primero, identificar, advertir y argumentar
        las posibles inconvenientes (sin prestigio) de expresión en textos de autores
        españoles. \n2. Segundo, estudiar y evaluar las alternativas y variaciones
        (¿de estilo?) entre dos versiones españolas actuales de «Los amigos de Eddie
        Coyle», de G. V. Higgins (1973 [El Chivato] frete a la versión de 2011), \n3.
        Tercero, estudiar y evaluar empíricamente algunos aspectos significativos
        de las alternativas y variaciones del español en España y en Argentina con
        datos de las cuatro versiones en español de J. D. Salinger («El guardián entre
        el centeno», versiones españolas de 1978 y de 2007; y «El cazador oculto»,
        versiones argentinas de 1961 y de 1998). \n\nEstos dos últimos objetivos tiene
        más valor por dos motivos: \n•\tLos textos de observación cumplen, sin duda,
        una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación empírica lingüística: la
        condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo, en los textos
        de Higgins) o alternativa (con variaciones de lengua, argentina y americana,
        o bien peninsular, en las versiones de Salinger), que dicen, o pretenden decir
        lo dicho en el texto fuente.\n•\tLas versiones de ‘El guardián…’ / ‘El cazador…’,
        desde distintos asuntos permiten referirse a las variaciones de lengua según
        los diferentes momentos de la versión o según la variedad territorial de lengua.
        \n\nNo es un curso sobre datos. Es un curso que, con algunos datos, opera
        sobre la competencia en advertir inconvenientes o aciertos expresivos y sobre
        la valoración y argumentación de diferentes alternativas de expresión y de

        раз увидеть, чем сто раз услышать или прочитать! \n• Именно эксперименты позволяют
        продемонстрировать и легко понять и простые, и сложные аспекты, которые традиционно
        преподаются в виде теоретического материала и математических моделей\n• Курс
        поможет Вам научиться использовать: \n   o эксперимент как способ постановки
        вопроса, \n   o эксперимент как инструмент изучения физического явления\n   o
        эксперимент как  форму ответа на вопрос\n• Очень часто достаточно «простые»
        физические вопросы имеют неожиданные ответы, которые зависят от конкретных
        условий проведения эксперимента. Демонстрация таких опытов и объяснение полученных
        в них результатов могут оказаться чрезвычайно интересными\n• Вы сможете увидеть
        применение изучаемых физических явлений в жизни, в технике и в быту\n• Изучая
        этот курс, вы восполните нехватку времени на экспериментальную, «живую» физику,
        которая ощущается в обычном учебном процесс\n\nЧему учит этот курс?\n• Пониманию
        широкого круга как простых, так и сложных физических явлений и процессов по
        тематике соответствующих разделов\n• Применению физических закономерностей
        для анализа различных физических явлений и процессов \n• Навыкам  использования
        эксперимента\n• Базовым знаниям по физике будущих инженеров и специалистов
        в различных областях деятельности.\n\nДля кого этот курс?\n• Для тех, кто

        Value, you will explore the most powerful generator of value in the world
        – ideas.  Ideas are the engines of productivity, both in the private and public
        sectors.  You will learn about the universal frameworks that determine how
        ideas and money interact, leading to the allocation of financial resources.  We
        will identify components of cash flow for any project, business or venture
        as the most essential ingredients of value. We also assess the investment
        techniques used to give life to some ideas while killing others.  This course
        will help you understand pricing, diversification, uncertainty and even behavioural
        approaches to dealing with risk.  Using Nobel Prize-winning insights, you
        will learn how to measure the size of the risk premium and build valuation
        models. We’ll even connect evidence-based science with common-sense analysis
        to give you better tools for understanding why values are what they are, and
        for positioning  yourself more effectively to participate in financial  markets.

        course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into
        3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of
        Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most
        lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including
        recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities
        to reflect on your studies.\n\nDue to the lengthiness of this class and natural

        назад определение нуклеотидной последовательности ДНК организма было почти
        невыполнимой задачей. Сегодня же секвенирование ДНК стало для специалистов
        чуть ли не рутинной работой – и тщательное изучение геномов принесло множество
        сюрпризов. Например, ученые обнаружили в генетическом материале ядерных организмов
        до 98 % молчащей, не кодирующей белки ДНК. Какие тайны скрываются в этих участках?
        \nЭтот курс познакомит вас с основными терминами и современными исследованиями
        в области генетики. От разбора молекулярного носителя наследственности, молекулы
        ДНК мы  перейдем к подробному изучению ее функциональных единиц – генов. Вы
        научитесь решать увлекательные генетические задачи и ориентироваться в причинах
        и последствиях мутаций. Студенты узнают законы классической генетики и столкнутся
        с тем, что и здесь на каждое правило есть свое исключение.\n\nПочему у голубоглазых
        родителей не может быть кареглазых детей? \nЧто общего между дальтонизмом
        у человека и черепаховой окраской у кошек? \nОтчего седеют лошади и не слышит
        голубоглазый кот? \n\nВместе с учеными-генетиками мы ответим на эти и другие
        вопросы и увидим, какие серьезные изменения в эволюционной биологии и биомедицине
        произошли сегодня благодаря появлению современных методов исследования ДНК.\n\nНаш

        goods and services are subject to scarcity at some level. Scarcity means that
        society must develop some allocation mechanism – rules to determine who gets
        what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based
        – the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries
        have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as
        rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging
        or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation
        of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior
        and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium
        price “rations” the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government
        intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could
        be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both
        forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand. \n\nAfter this
        course, you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by
        the demand curve.\n•\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply
        curve.\n•\tExplain equilibrium in a market.\n•\tExplain the impact of taxes

        the focus will be on the music, we will also consider how recording techniques,
        the music business, the music of other artists, and the culture of the 1960s
        affected John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they created the Beatles repertory.\n\nThere
        is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music
        than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band''s biography, several
        insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret
        the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding
        the band. This course will try to synthesize much of that information into
        an account of the Beatles'' development as musicians and songwriters.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0e/61a0fd462aa2524f71915233b3530b/Beatles-red-legal-safe-copy.jpg","name":"The

        you want to be able to converse with specialists about anything from regression
        and classification to deep learning and recommender systems?\n\nIn this course,
        you will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical
        case-studies.  At the end of the first course you will have studied how to
        predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from
        user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search
        for images.  Through hands-on practice with these use cases, you will be able
        to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.\n\nThis first
        course treats the machine learning method as a black box.  Using this abstraction,
        you will focus on understanding tasks of interest, matching these tasks to
        machine learning tools, and assessing the quality of the output. In subsequent
        courses, you will delve into the components of this black box by examining
        models and algorithms.  Together, these pieces form the machine learning pipeline,
        which you will use in developing intelligent applications.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By
        the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Identify potential applications
        of machine learning in practice.  \n   -Describe the core differences in analyses
        enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.\n   -Select the appropriate
        machine learning task for a potential application.  \n   -Apply regression,

        your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. \n   -Assess
        the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.\n   -Utilize
        a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.\n   -Build an end-to-end application

        in meditation, mindfulness, and contemplation has grown exponentially in recent
        years.  Rather than being seen as mystical practices from ancient Buddhism
        or esoteric philosophy, they are increasingly seen as technologies rooted
        in evidence from psychology and neuroscience.  Mindfulness has become the
        basis for numerous therapeutic interventions, both as a treatment in healthcare
        and as a means of enhancing well-being and happiness.  For millions around
        the world, mindfulness has become a life-style choice, enhancing and enriching
        everyday experience. Mindfulness is big business.\n\nBut, what actually is
        mindfulness?  Is it really good for you?  Can anyone learn it?  How can you
        recognize charlatans? Would you want to live in a mindful society, and would
        it smell like sandalwood?  What does it feel like to be mindful?  Are you
        mindful already, and how would you know?\n\nEvolving from the popular Honours
        Academy course at Leiden University, this innovative course combines conventional
        scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from psychology, through
        philosophy, to politics) with experiential learning (including specially designed
        ‘meditation labs,’ in which you’ll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness
        on yourself).  In the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive,
        and inclusive education about (and in) mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon.\n\nDuring

        forms the basis of modern medicine. Clinical research provides us with this
        evidence, guiding health professionals towards solutions to problems that
        they face in daily practice. Transferring existing problems in medical practice
        to a research setting is a challenging process that requires careful consideration.
        The practice of clinical epidemiology aims to address this through the application
        of established approaches for research in human populations, while at all
        times focussing on the problem at hand from a clinical perspective.\n\nThis
        course teaches the principles and practice of clinical epidemiology, drawing
        on real problems faced by medical professionals and elaborating on existing
        examples of clinical research. Medical researchers will lean how to translate
        real clinical problems into tangible research questions for investigation,
        gaining insight into some of the most important considerations when designing
        an epidemiological study along the way. \n\nCore concepts will be introduced

        presents some important vignettes of a complex, highly diverse India that

        change, the continuing influence of ancient texts on contemporary India, political

        India''s economic globalisation and changing world view.\n\nWhile one of the

        critically examines some of the tensions inherent in these changes. For example,
        how does gender inequality play itself out in a changing Indian society, how
        do the modernist conceptions of art entailing market valuation challenge the
        more socio-centric values found in South India, what are the politics linguistic

        are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share
        with fellow Learners, and with Professors Peter Glendinning and Mark Sullivan
        too!  A unique feature of this Course is the individual review and responsive
        input you will receive directly from Peter or Mark, who will be viewing your
        pictures and making evaluations of all projects at the end of the Capstone.  You
        should plan on spending more time on this Course per week than any other in
        this Specialization, and much of it will be in making photographs.\n\nDuring
        the entire period of development, you and your fellow learners will be supporting
        each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress from
        the initial Project Plan to the final Portfolio.  At each stage, all Learners
        will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping each other to
        gauge progress and to learn about different approaches to photography and
        content.  By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response
        to the work of others, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence
        as well.  \n\nAlong the way there will be multiple opportunities for sharing
        pictures and ideas through carefully designed Peer Review.  This sharing of
        photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about
        your photos, will be an exciting learning experience that will help you grow
        in understanding your own photography and that of others.  Your contribution
        of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs
        better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms
        that are related to techniques, design principles, and content approaches
        that you have learned through your success in each of the previous Modules.  \n\nA
        unique aspect of this Specialization is that everyone who completes the requirements  will
        receive, in addition to their Certificate of Specialization from Michigan
        State University, access to substantial discounts on equipment, accessories,
        and membership benefits through Industry Partners from among the premier manufacturers
        of photography equipment and related items:  Fracture, Gary Fong, Gyst, Lensbaby,
        LensPen, Lume Cube Lighting, Photo District News, PhotoVideoEdu, Think Tank
        Cases/Bags.  In addition, The ''top-10'' peer-reviewed Capstone projects each
        year will be awarded the opportunity for individual reviews, with personal
        responses, by world renowned photographers who have been honored with the
        title of Canson-Infinity® Paper Ambassadors.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/92/7e0dc0b4d011e5924df12e94b982e7/Coursera-Specialization-Thumbnail-IMG_2026-copy.jpg","id":"0wR1g5n1EeWt-Ao8imSkCQ","slug":"photography-project","name":"Photography

        you will learn what the main financial markets and their characteristics are
        as well as how they are linked to the economy. \n\nOur very diversified team
        of experts will start by teaching you how the price of stocks and bonds are
        computed and why they move while you will become increasingly aware of the
        notion of risk and why it matters when measuring an investment''s performance.
        The focus will then move to less popular markets such as gold, emerging markets,
        real estate, hedge funds and private markets. These will be analyzed with
        an emphasis on their particular risks and return opportunities as well as
        how they can help in building efficient portfolios. Finally, the policies
        of central banks and their impact on financial markets will be presented to
        you along with the link between the economy and the price of financial assets.\n\nAll
        along these different steps, experts from UBS, our corporate partner, will
        show you how the concepts you just acquired are effectively applied in a leading
        global bank. This focus on practicality means you will not only understand

        thinking is crucial for farmers because they depend on good economic decision

        contribute to better decision making by farmers, or by agencies servicing
        agriculture, and it will help you to understand why farmers respond to policies
        and economic opportunities in the ways they do. \n\nYou can use this course
        to improve your skills and knowledge, and to assess whether this is a subject
        that you''d like to study further. The course includes high-quality video
        lectures, interviews with experts, demonstrations of how to build economic
        models in spreadsheets, practice quizzes, and a range of recommended readings
        and optional readings. Assessment is by a final exam. \n\nThe key economic
        principles that we’ll learn about can help us understand changes that have
        occurred in agriculture, and support improved decision making about things
        like agricultural production methods, agricultural input levels, resource

        a company in the food and beverage industry is a fascinating task.\n\nFood
        and beverage products are so deeply rooted in the culture of most countries
        that making and selling them is not only a matter of making and selling good
        and tasty products, but products that nurture people''s body, soul, and heart.
        Given this, it''s not difficult to see that the task quickly becomes complex.\n\nThe
        objective of this course is twofold: first, we will focus on contemporary
        challenges that managers and entrepreneurs in food and beverage businesses
        should be able to face; and second, we will provide models and tools to design
        and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers and build
        an advantage over the competition.\n\nThis course is made up of four modules
        and an introduction, each exploring one dilemma that food and beverage companies
        face. You will be presented with a set of video lectures and guest speakers.
        These lectures combine an accessible introduction to specific topics integrated
        with interviews of managers and experts that will give precious insights and
        examples to the participants.\n\nTo enhance your learning experience with
        us, we will make a Documentary on the Excellences of the Modena District available

        course in order to give you the chance to experience first-hand the territory
        as our on-campus students usually do.\n\nEach module is paired with an evaluated
        quiz and weekly discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the F&B world,
        its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during
        the course.\n\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course

        a range of survey data collection methods that are both interview-based (face-to-face

        the fundamental principles underlying cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) starting
        with the basic anatomy of electron microscopes, an introduction to Fourier
        transforms, and the principles of image formation. Building upon that foundation,
        the class then covers the sample preparation issues, data collection strategies,
        and basic image processing workflows for all 3 basic modalities of modern
        cryo-EM: tomography, single particle analysis, and 2-D crystallography.\n\nPhilosophy:\nThe
        course emphasizes concepts rather than mathematical details, taught through
        numerous drawings and example images.  It is meant for anyone interested in
        the burgeoning fields of cryo-EM and 3-D EM, including cell biologists or
        molecular biologists without extensive training in mathematics or imaging
        physics and practicing electron microscopists who want to broaden their understanding
        of the field.  The class is perfect as a primer for anyone who is about to
        be trained as a cryo-electron microscopist, or for anyone who needs an introduction
        to the field to be able to understand the literature or the talks and conversations
        they will hear at cryo-EM meetings.\n\nPre-requisites:\nThe recommended prerequisites
        are college-freshman-level math, physics, and biochemistry.\n\nPace: \nThere
        are 14.5 hours of lecture videos total separated into 40 individual “modules”
        lasting on average 20 minutes each.  Each module has at the end a list of
        “concept check” questions you can use to test your knowledge of what was presented.
        As the modules are grouped into seven major subjects, one reasonable plan
        would be to go through one major subject each day.  That would mean watching
        a couple hours of lecture and spending another hour or so thinking through
        the concept check questions each day for a week.  Another reasonable plan
        would be to go through one module each day for a little over a month, or even
        three modules a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a 3-month term.\n\nIt
        is likely that as you then move on to actually begin using a cryo-EM or otherwise
        engage in the field, you will want to repeat certain modules.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/cryoem/cryo-em_banner_model_no_blur.jpg","name":"Getting

        to Steven Blank a business startup, or any new venture startup is essentially
        a proto-type. Thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process
        to refine that business proto-type into a scalable, replicable finished ''product''.\n\nAt
        the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -complete a business
        model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and
        how they will make \n    money.\n   - systematically test and validate these
        assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and\n   -
        use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are
        based on actual resources and efforts expended.\n\nThe days of the 40 page
        business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business
        creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore
        the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business
        creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make
        sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.\n\nThe planning
        here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail
        all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful
        when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture
        and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based
        largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with
        the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value
        the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will
        guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating
        these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show
        learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial
        statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/75d4f0be5111e59c1bb1844bad7ba4/planning-resize.jpg","id":"BySMWm04EeW8nRIpKnwp7Q","slug":"business-planning","name":"Planning:

        of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started
        as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It
        was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a
        mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German
        officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20%
        of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point,
        biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that
        traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be
        needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.\n\nTo
        investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak
        strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released
        bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst
        of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They
        even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki\n\nThe

        The theory is, those who commit the worst of human crimes, are held accountable,
        whether they are rank-and-file foot soldiers or military commanders, whether
        they are lowly civil servants following orders or top political leaders. We
        will test  how this can be done and if this is realistic.\n\nDuring this course,
        you will be offered a look into the ‘kitchen’ of the Hague international criminal

        business school researchers have identified a powerful model for making business
        decisions that is based on economics, law and ethics.  The Three Pillar model
        in this course expands this model by adding strategy in place of economics.  With
        this change, the model becomes a practical framework that you can use to make
        all types of decisions—business, leadership and personal.\n\nThis course uses
        business decision making to show you how to use the model.  In essence, to
        achieve business and career success, you must manage risk (the Law Pillar)
        and create value (the Strategy Pillar) in a responsible manner (the Ethics
        Pillar).\n\nBecause the Law Pillar is especially important and challenging,
        the course provides legal briefings (with many examples) on the key elements
        of business success, such as (1) attracting the best employees, (2) developing
        successful products, (3) creating new business models, (4) protecting intellectual
        property, (5) creating contracts that achieve business goals, and (6) using
        dispute resolution processes that improve business relationships. \n\nIn taking
        a global perspective in covering these elements, the course provides an introduction
        to the global business culture to learners from the United States, and an
        introduction to the US business culture to learners from outside the US. \n\nWith
        this background on the Law Pillar, after completing this course you should
        be able to:\n\n- Manage the key risks you face in business.\n- Create value
        for your business by linking the Law Pillar to the Strategy Pillar.\n- Use
        the Ethics Pillar to become a leader in creating or managing a business that
        serves the interests of society while creating profits for its shareholders.\n\nAfter
        you master the Three Pillar model for business decisions, you can easily apply
        the model to your personal decisions and to leadership decisions in non-business
        settings.\n\nHow to successfully complete this course (4 steps):\n\n(1) Watch
        the short videos for each module.  The videos are interactive and include
        questions to test your understanding of the Three Pillars model.  You can
        watch them week-by-week or you can binge watch them.  Someone who binge-watched
        my first MOOC (“Successful Negotiation:  Essential Strategies and Skills”)
        concluded “It’s as good as ‘Breaking Bad.’”\n\n(2) Do the readings.  The readings
        are short and designed to help you use the Three Pillar model in making everyday
        business decisions.  They reinforce the videos and add additional coverage.
        \n\n(3) “Show what you know” by taking the practice quizzes at the end of
        each module.\n\n(4) Take the final examination.  The exam is a Mastery Exam,
        which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master
        the material.   \n\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate through
        the verification of your identity and successful completion of the course.  A
        Certificate provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course
        and includes the University of Michigan logo.  If you''re considering getting
        a Course Certificate, you should complete the verification process before
        taking the Final Exam. You can choose to pay the associated fee before or
        after the exam.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0f/60c280f1f111e5a06e31881a7e175f/SLE_Thumbnail_TO_031416_FINAL.jpg","id":"3Mf1LkHGEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ","slug":"strategy-law-ethics","name":"The

        is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions. Learn
        and practice concepts, techniques, and get to grips with the latest thinking
        on assessing and formulating pricing strategies. Analyze how firms attempt
        to capture value, as well as profits, in the revenues they earn. \n\nAfter
        this course, you will be able to contribute to the process of formulating
        pricing strategies for your own products and services, or those of your firm.
        This course has an additional focus on pricing dynamics and the reaction to
        and by competitors, taking a highly pragmatic approach and one that is directly
        applicable to your day-to-day professional life.\n\nThis course is made up
        of the following four modules:\n\n1 - In this module we will start with the
        importance of pricing, especially for the bottom line. Having this in mind,
        and after showing how pricing is the most important driver of profitability,
        when you finish this module you will be able to execute cost, competition
        and customer-based pricing. You will also be able to use the concepts of price
        elasticity and optimal price while setting prices for your products and services.\n\n2
        - After finishing this module you will be able to take advantage of four different
        methods to determine the willingness to pay from customers. Whether using
        Market Data or Experiments (Observation based) or Expert or Customer Surveys
        (Survey based), you''ll be able to use this information in order to identify
        the optimal price.\n\n3 - What we see in the real world is that companies
        don''t only charge one price for all their products, but rather set different
        prices for different products with respect to different customer segments.
        After looking at the benefits of price discrimination (and the significant
        revenue and profit potential behind it), you will be able to figure out what
        type and how to implement price discrimination for your products and services.\n\n4
        - In this final module we will look at pricing psychology. You will then be
        able to \"manipulate\" customers so they perceive a higher value in the products
        and services that you deliver, or so that they feel less pain by paying the
        price of purchasing your products. You will have in your toolkit multiple
        ways to maximize your sales, revenues, and profitability. We will also conduct
        a couple of experiments with volunteer customers to see how price affects
        perceptions, and how you can profit from it.","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/79/9bc96015dc11e6b00bbd15c77cf496/marketing-Pricing-Strategy.jpg","id":"Zx7vV31ZEeWKYwric11Hpw","slug":"pricing-strategy","name":"Pricing

        the course will provide you with five benefits or outcomes. First your attitude
        will be finely focused and tuned to the mindset concepts covered in course
        one that are likely to have the greatest impact on your business launch. Second
        in a similar fashion you will become keenly aware of those aspects of your
        business that directly impact its ability to create and deliver value on day
        one; and have actions plans to address each aspect. With your ''mind right''
        and your ''business right'' the third and fourth outcomes of the course are
        actions plans to get your ''market connections'' right. The course will allow
        you to explore strategies and tactics to engage the market, communication
        your message, and generate sales; and select those which give you the best
        opportunity to learn and establish a foundation for growth. Finally the course
        will walk you through a final checklist of operational issues that will allow
        you to enter the capstone course and your business launch ready to go on day
        one.\n\nThroughout the course we have emphasized the importance of market

        We also invite you to change your own behavior to do more good. You will learn
        how to spot BS (bad science) in the media, how to evaluate whether a social
        program works or not, and how your career could have a better impact on this
        world. Finally, you will develop your own plan on how you are going to do
        good better with science. \n\nGuest speakers include Behavioral Economist

        is, among human sciences, the discipline with the strongest importance for
        the rediscovery, but also for the preservation and protection of cultural
        heritage, as Humankind’s universal patrimony. You will be introduced to the
        way we ourselves reflect on and are engaged with the study of human past:
        from the practical and material recovery of ancient traces in the field to
        the study and interpretation. On the other hand, the discovery of human past
        implies the correct conservation and presentation for both experts and general
        public: the study and protection of the past we share every day prevent from
        any possible destruction, misuse, abuse and thus cancellation of human memory.\n“Recovering
        the Humankind''s Past and Saving the Universal Heritage” presents to a large
        public Archaeology as a historical discipline: through an inter-disciplinary
        perspective you will follow the evolution and change of archaeology to the
        moment when natural sciences contributed to make the historical reconstructions
        scientifically sound; the aid of informatics and of virtual reconstructions
        gives new fascination to the already strong suggestion of Archaeology, as
        the discipline of discovery par excellence. Within this frame, Ebla, which
        is the glory of the Sapienza school of Oriental archaeology, will have an
        exemplary meaning in the course development as a long lasting experience on
        the field and an excellent example of the scientific results of combined researches

        cultural heritage in particular in terms of preservation and dissemination
        of cultural objects.\n\nIn this course you will  learn the basic techniques  to
        digitize cultural objects and obtain 3D digital copies of a physical objects
